The solderless easy to construct and modify Orion Explorer robot 1 kit is a good start for any robotics project or fun. However - pair it with a bluetooth module and it becomes a robot you can drive from your phone or tablet!

<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SpMrGylvcs0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="225" width="300"></iframe></p>

The kit includes the standard Explorer 1 Robot platform with four wheel drive motors, wheels, Arduino (Uno R3 or Leonardo) compatible microcontroller, motor board and batteries. The whole assembly requires no soldering, cutting or drilling - only a screwdriver, computer and batteries are needed. It's designed to be extended and tinkered with - to Explore electronics and robotics.

It uses the HC-06 bluetooth serial module - a simple device that allows sending serial data to and from the robot. This means you can add other sensors, and read those from it.
