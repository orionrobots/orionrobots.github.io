This cool module gives your robot or project a simple display to communicate back to you with. It is assembled with headers already attached so you can start using it with breadboards and Arduino controllers without reaching for a soldering iron.
You could use it to show arrows when a robot is moving or turning, emoticons for a robot pet, bar graphs for sensor indication, debugging info, or just doing a message.
It is based on the MAX7219 controller chip in a DIP package. This chip only uses 3 IO pins, and multiple modules can be daisy chained together to create larger displays! There is example code to drive the module from an Arduino, and the chip is well documented.
