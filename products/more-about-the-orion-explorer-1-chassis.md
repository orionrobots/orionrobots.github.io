title: More About The Orion Explorer 1 Chassis
---
This chassis is a perfect starting point for building a robot. It comes with 4 wheels, a body with two decks for attaching boards, sensors and accessories to, and 4 geared motors to drive the wheels. The motors have presoldered cables so it can be used completely solderless - saving you time so you can assemble the robot and have it moving in no time.

It is the basis of the <a title="Orion Explorer 1 Robot Kit" href="http://shop.orionrobots.co.uk/products/orion-explorer-1-robot-kit">Orion Explorer 1 Robot Building Kit</a>

* Black Plastic Chassis - 2 layers
* 4 Yellow Tired Wheels
* 4 Geared DC motors - with presoldered red/black wires.
