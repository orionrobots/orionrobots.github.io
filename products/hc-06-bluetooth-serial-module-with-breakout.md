The HC-06 Bluetooth Serial module allows you to add Bluetooth remote serial control to your robot. This means that you can interact with programs on your robot remotely.

 The HC-06 is in slave mode and already mounted on a baseboard for easy use without soldering - and converting the Rx/Tx lines to 5v for use with the Arduino and similar microcontrollers.
