If you have physically built your robot - The Orion Robots Explorer 1, the 4tronix Initio, Mr basic + arduino and others, you will now need to program it.

# Testing the Arduino

First you should test you have a real working Arduino- plug it into a USB port, and watch the Arduino - a number of LED lights should turn on, and one of them should be blinking slowly. If you can see the slow blinking - you have a working Arduino.

# Downloading the Arduino Software

If you've not already - now is the time to download the Arduino software.

* Download the Arduino app on your computer from http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
* Follow the On-site instructions to install it. This works for Linux, Mac and Windows
* You will have either an Uno or Leonardo based board. Follow these to get it installed and communicated:
** Leonardo: http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoLeonardoMicro#toc8
** Uno: http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage  (choose your platform in the installation section)
