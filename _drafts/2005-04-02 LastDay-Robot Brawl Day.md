The plan for this last even is a fun robot brawl day. The kids will be split into two teams, and will be given a pile of parts to build a remote controlled robot. They will then compete in a number of rounds to see who has the best robot.

- Use the Two lego Manas + The Spybotics (allow kids to choose)
- They have 45 minutes as two teams to build remote buggies.
- Each of them needs to be steerable using the Manas handset.

The team with the most points will get the better prizes - we now have quite a number to choose from. Players are not allowed to remove pieces or reconfigure their robot between rounds. They may use parts from their robot to repair it between rounds.

## Points are awarded for the following:

(Photos will be taken from a number of angles for the first two rounds)
Style:
The one judged the best looking gets 2 points

Engineering:
The one that looks the best engineered (not style) also gets 4 points

Weight:
The lightest gets 4 points

Race Round:
The fastest vehicle gets 10 points
 
Sumo:
The vehicle who stays in the arena the longest gets 10 points.
We will allow only 4 minutes for each round - so fight well.

Behaviour:
The team with the best behaved members gets 8 points

Drop Test:
Each will be dropped from around knee height.
There will be 3 points awarded for each successive drop.
I will deduct one point for each piece that falls off at the drops.

The points will be totalled up.
In the event of a tie - we reserve the right to choose one more easily judge-able criteria or round.
