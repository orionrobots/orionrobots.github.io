Good fun robot brawl day

Use the Two Manas + The Spybotics (allow kids to choose)
They have 45Minutes as two teams to build remote buggies.
Each of them needs to be steerable using the Manas handset.

The team with the most points will get the better prizes - we now have quite a number to choose from.
Players are not allowed to remove pieces or reconfigure their robot for any rounds.

Points are awarded for the following:

(Photos will be taken from a number of angles for the first two rounds)
Style:
The one I judge the best looking gets 2 points

Engineering:
The one that looks the best engineered (not style) also gets 4 points

Weight:
The lightest gets 4 points

Race Round:
The fastest vehicle gets 10 points

Sumo:
The vehicle who stays in the arena the longest gets 10 points.
We will allow only 4 minutes for each round - so fight well.

Behaviour:
The team with the best behaved members gets 8 points

Drop Test:
Each will be dropped from around knee height.
There will be 3 points awarded for each successive drop.
I will deduct one point for each piece that falls off at the drops.

The points will be totalled up.
n the event of a tie - I reserve the right to choose one more easily judge-able criteria or round.
