Creation Story:
* I've been doing robots and electronics since I was a kid. I was always into the practical side, having fun, making a cool hack more than pure theory. I ran kids sessions with robots but found that Lego was expensive, having enough kits and reaching to a greater audience was hard.
I am a regular at PyconUk, and an education track started there around the same time the Raspberry Pi was introduced - we got talking about how kids could be brought into coding and technology. The idea for making kids robot kids started to form. I attempted making and marketing robot kits.
Aside from this - I started making video about my kit - and found I had a lot of fun doing stuff.


Why am i into robots and electronics? What do I have to share?
What is my creation story?

Community Creed - what viewers want - audience has something - what inspires you?

Like minded robot hackers - practical, not theory- simplicity - layman accessible.


Creed: Doing electronics, robotics and code for fun - throw stuff together, see what happens. Make things.
It doesn't matter what level you are at - age you are at, orionrobots is about having a go at make something, and helping a community of makers with questions about how to make stuff.
