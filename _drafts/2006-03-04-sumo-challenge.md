## Piece Separation Guide

- The rules state not using teeth
- Include diagrams, or at least a few words on techniques for getting pieces apart

It is clearly stated in all the rules, that I do not allow pieces between teeth. I do understand that sometimes they can become quite firmly stuck. In many situations following this guide will help.
The firm rule is to keep your cool. Remember that brute force rarely helps and may just end up with broken parts, as well as frustration and anger. Think a little bit about the situation - there is normally a sneaky way to sort it out. Here are a few common ones:

A friction pin stuck in a hole/beam:

- For this you need to build a small bench two beams high, and a plunger with handle. Use an axle for the plunger end. You place the stuck item so the stuck joint is facing away from you, then push the plunger down into the stiff joint. By using plates and Non-Friction pins you can add another beam to the side of this which will better guide the plunger and increase your success.
- If you are in an assembly where you cannot push, or you have a stuck axle pin then there is another method. First get yourself another beam, and clip the beam on top of the outward end of the stuck pin. Then push one of the flex pieces into the hole (to ensure the clip stays in the new beam). Pull the beam out keeping the flex in the hole, and it will pull the pin from the object in which it is stuck. If it is a friction pin and is now stiff/stuck in the new beam then use the plunger method to remove it completely.

If two small 2x1 plates get stuck together, place a 2x1 brick above and below the plates, then bend the assembly keeping a finger over the mid line of the two plates. It should pop apart. This technique has a nack to it but is effective. It also applies for most of the X x 1 plates, and the right angle corner plates. Plates that are 2x2 can be separated similarly with 2x2 or 4x2 bricks above and below. For larger plates wider than 2 studs this technique is less useful.

Use the brick separator to remove bricks or plates off of larger plates. The separator is essentially a lever, you push it onto the brick you want to remove, and push down the handle to pop it off.

If you get a gear stuck on an axle, pull the axle through a beam until the gear pops off.

If you have a large complex assembly try first dropping it from knee height ;-) No higher! Then if it still does not come apart you are in for the longer task of pulling it apart piece by piece. Stuff like that normally comes apart in exactly the same order it went together in but you may have to use any of the above techniques to get them apart.

If the challenge involves pneumatic parts, and you get a tube firmly stuck on the push joint, try gently tugging it off. If it really fails to come off, get help from an adult since the tube is much less valuable than the pneumatic part. They can slit the tube so it comes off easily, then trim the cut part off the tube.

Finally if you are completely out of ideas, ask the team. We will think of something.

## My intro script

Introducing myself and Orionrobots - 2 minutes - brief skeleton of what is in the document:

Hi all, please make sure you have the handouts - there are more than enough for everyone.
I am Danny, and I will be getting you guys to build robots with me. OrionRobots has been building robots, as well as reading, writing about robots for a few years. In fact - OrionRobots eats, drinks, sleeps and breathes robots.
We have a website at <https://orionrobots.co.uk> - where you can read about our past challenges, and those to come - and if you read carefully - you may find information on the new secret challenge I am working on - known only as "The pyramid Challenge".
There are other workshops we run, and information on this is in the handouts and the website.
If you want more background, have a read of the handouts later - right now, lets get on with building robots!
Before we start putting brick to brick, I have a few things we need to cover.

Rules - These are quite serious rules - some may lead to exclusion from the activity, others to team disqualification - which will not make you popular.

- No sabotage - if you break another teams model, or snaffle a piece - that may lead to team disqualification from at least one round, and will at lest lead to exclusion.
- No aggression - The only acceptable place for any type of this is in the arena. Any throwing, kicking, punching etc outside will lead to exclusions
- No pieces in teeth - These pieces are easily damaged by teeth - and I despise teeth marks. You will be made to sit out for 10 minutes of the build phase if you are caught doing this. There is a guide to separating pieces - and failing that, come and see me - I can usually think of something. Besides - this stuff has been used in a number of indoor and outdoor challenges, pawed by many kids with varying levels of washing - and there is no knowing where it has been or what you could catch by chewing on it!
- Do not start building before the build time starts, and do stop when the time finishes - we are on a tight schedule, and there will be no extensions. You will 5 minutes tweak time after the break, before the round, and a little tweak time between each round.
- Do not squabble over pieces. There is a very large number of Lego pieces here - one or two are unique - but there is always more than one way to do something, and often a piece that is similar enough to do the job well. Both squabblers will be excluded for 10 minutes of build time.
- Do not horde pieces - this is considered a sabotage strategy. It is okay to collect a few pieces for use, and acceptable to prepare groups of pieces to place them - but if you gather all of the wheels (normally 6 wheels of any type are quite enough) or something similar, I will ask them to be redistributed. Again - there are enough pieces, and that kind of behaviour is not very competitive.
- Please listen to what I have to say - I have a lot of experience with this, and by not listening to the advice I give, you will be punishing yourself - by missing out on what could be the information that wins the challenge!
- Adults are encouraged to participate - but they may only suggest, they can gather pieces, and are generally encouraged to help the teams work well together. Adults are not to take over though - from time to time I do run adult workshops, but this is really for the kids. This means for today, your child may ask you to put that together like so, and while you may suggest that you think it is a bad idea, if they insist - then go ahead and do it. The warning to the kids is to listen to the suggestions - it is likely they are right!

I generally encourage good sportsmanship, and for teams to help each other out a little. While this is competitive, everyone will achieve more if they co-operate. Teams are encouraged to spend a few minutes forming a general plan for their robot, and working together to achieve it. It a team fragments - there are not enough motor modules, and only one fragment will get to participate. It is however an acceptable strategy to get two sections of the team working on different solutions to a problem and choosing a result.

"We are here to have lots of good safe fun, and hopefully learn stuff on the way!"

## Challenge

Today's challenge is building, and battling sumo robots. These robots may be wheeled or tracked. The robots will need to race in the arena, then battle to push each other out of it. The challenge is based upon points - and the team with the greatest number of points wins. Points are awarded for coming top in the races and battles, for good teamwork, for style and for weight. In the case of a tie (unlikely), then the best engineered robot (in my opinion) will win. My decision is final - no cries of unfair.

With sumo bots in this challenge you need to consider a few major design issues, and one or two minor ones. The major design issues are steering, traction, power and strength. The minor issues are style and weight.

Steering - you need to be able to manoeuvre your robot both when racing, and when sumo battling. A robot that is hard to steer will frustrate the driver, and may end up a sitting duck on the arena.

Traction - you need to ensure your wheels are touching the ground, and gripping it. A robot that slips and slides will be very difficult to steer, and will have no pushing or staying power. Chunky treads are a good way to get traction.

Power - You need to use gear ratios gearing down to get more pushing power when actually doing the sumo - however, beware that yuo don't make yourself too slow for the race. Worm gears are fantastic for this.

Strength - The robot is likely to get rammed by other robots in the arena. You need to be prepared for this - so having a decent cross braced strong structure is important - don't build stuff that falls off at the first tap.

Style - A good looking robot will get additional points, although not all that many - don't go overboard on this

Weight - These points are also limited, but are good design considerations anyway - a smaller simpler robot will have fewer points of failure - and while a solid lump of bricks may be heavy - they are not always the strongest structures. Use cross bracing, even vertically for serious strength and lowering the weight and piece count. Points are awarded for the lowest weight.

Be aware of the time - you have only 45 minutes to build in, and don't try to be over ambitious. It is a good strategy to get a basic wheeled robot working first (please make sure it steers well and drives), and then build on that. The first thing you should think about are your wheels, the next is your strength (not falling apart), and finally style. Try not to get carried away with style - especially if it is going to weaken the model, fall off easily or get in the way of the workings.

## The Challenge Events

Weighing - Each of the bots will be weighed for their points. Lower weights win

Style - A panel of 6 adults (2 from each team) will be set up to give points out of 10 on the style of each robot - these are averaged. The overall best wins.

Then a set of timed races - the course is not wide enough for two at a time, so each team must make their attempt for the best time on the track. Straying outside the borders of the track will cost a 20 second penalty. The team with the bets times get 10 points.

- Tactics - Steady and slow and controlled is often better - there are obstacles on the race, and a number of turns - so racing away is likely to get you time penalties, completely out of the arena, or worst - stuck on an obstacle - how embarrassing.

Sumo - First there will be an event in the small square arena. This will be two teams going head to head in a small tournament. The first robot to be pushed out, or drive out of the arena, will loose - and the other team will win. This means if your wheels go outside hazard tape border - you loose! If your robot falls apart - you loose! Each battle may last up to 3 minutes. Winners take 10 points.

- Tactics - If you both lock heads and just push, it is unlikely you will go anywhere. The better tactic is to dance around a little - trying to gain an advantage. If you can get a run up, your ram is more likely to damage, or push out. Try to trick the opponent into driving out of the arena.

Rumble - In the large arena, all three teams go in an all out battle. You have 5 minutes to do as much damage to the other teams robots, or push them out of the arena. The winner is the least damaged robot - or the last man standing - they get 20 points.

- Tactics - much like above, but since the arena is bigger- be a great deal more aggressive. Push, ram and shove. Show no mercy!

Drop Test - This is the most feared test. We take what remains from each robot (if they have survived the rumble) and drop them from knee height until they smash. Each team gets 5 times the number of drops as points.

- Tactics - Just make sure you have built a good strong robot.

At the end, all the points will be totalled - and we will award the winners with certificates! Everyone gets a participation certificate.

3, 2, 1 - Go build and create!
