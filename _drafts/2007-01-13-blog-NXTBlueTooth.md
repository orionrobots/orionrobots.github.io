title: NXT BlueTooth Fun
---
As I am beginning to tire of reconnecting the ((USB)) connector every time,
I think now is the moment to try out BlueTooth.

I have a BlueTooth dongle, but had to find it among the many gadgets as I will admit I do not use it often.
I then set about the task of getting it to work with the NXT.
The Bluetooth Dongle in question is a USB one, the Yakamoto Blueport.
