## Trouble with the handset

The handset assembly so far had given me no problems, I had carefully inserted the LCD, and the IC.  So I test with some batteries
pinched out of a couple of IR remotes, and it displays the language menu, allows me to select a language, then reset.  Obviously
the batteries are dead, so I put it down, and leave it until the IR module arrives....

After fitting the IR module(just the receiver/transmitter board), I then close the case, bought some batteries and powered
-up again.  Only this time the screen was just uniform black - no language select or anything.  No lines, or dots missing - good.

So I disassembled the unit, check it, and find no problems, reassembled it, and power up and I get the same.  Then I gave up,
leaving it powered up overnight.  I awoke this morning to find it was fine and was working great.  It then switched itself
off as per the magazine description.

Does anybody have any idea why this happened?  If you have any anomalous results with Cybot and how you got around them, please
let me know on my feedback page!

## A good starting block

Yes, a mention of the cybot here was inevitable. I am a regular subscriber to the real robots magazine.
And being into all things robotics, found it fairly interesting. The cybot, although a little of a closed system is an excellent introduction to robotics and can be modified in a fair few ways. I will be adding some extra hints and tips, and areas I had difficulty with myself. I recommend having a go - its not a bad little starting block.<br />

I will also be investigating the possibilities of extending it further and customizing the capabilities.  I will not go into cool shell mods as it is the behaviour that fascinates me.
