3D cad concepts
* To be able to embed all of the 2d components.
* solid meshes
* extrusions
* cuts
* rotations (lathed)
* subparts
* part mating/relationships/constraints
	* flush/mate
	* co-axial
	* co planar
	* measurements/offsets
*primitives
	* plane
	* cube
	* cylinder
	* pyramid
	* sphere
* boolean CSG operations
* surface embellishments
* geometry that can be marked as cosmetic/expendable
* extensible
* geometric deformations - a'la FFD from 3d studio
* bicubic 3d splines, NURBS.
* Properties - units, metric, imperial, LDU, custom
XML has been chosen for the files format as it is object oriented, and easily extendible, although for the sake of propriety - a binary format may be created later. That means that the internal representation and the written file must be decoupled.

Suggest using the composition pattern

Design Patterns In terms Of XMLDraw
-----------------------------------
* What is XMLDraw? XMLDraw is an exercise to build a CAD system based around an open xml file format with a free browser rendering plugin.

* The XML must be able to represent:
** Composite solid bodies with surface attributes, material characteristics
** Meta-information for the solid body
* explicit mechanical linkages
** 2D Sketches - both to base solid extrusions/poly's on, and as a CAD file in its own right.
** Multi-document files - embedding parts if preferred.

* The CAD tool must be able to
** render Parts & Drawings
** Have a consistent user interface
** edit parts, drawings & metainfo
** split or merge documents into multi-doc files.
** be extendable - to allow advanced properties windows for parts, or plugins like simulators.
** Do mechanical simulation & animation
** Have a sensible undo-redo system
** Become familiar & easy to use.
** import & export a number of formats.
** support a standard parts library & gallery (converted LDraw)
** Be cross-platform
** Allow users to configure most behaviour.

Quick answers
* Use WxWindows API for cross platform windowing+ look & eel.
* where possible, use XSLT for exports
  Revision 1
analyse File format - what do we need?
2D
* Curves - Splines & beziers, arcs
* points - vertices
* lines - line segments
* polygons which contain line segments
* primitives - circle, rect
* constrains - extendable
** colinear - two line segs or one line seg, one vertex
** perpendicular - two line segs, one line, one curve
** tangent - one line, one curve or one vertex, one curve.
** parallel - two lines
** concentric - two arcs
** Equal - Two line segs/two measurements, two points
** measurement/distance - specify the distance between two points/objects
** Construction Geometry - any geometery must be flaggable as construction
** Angle measurement - specify the angle between two line segs

* Sub-parts - parts from a library may be added.
* Standard reference to components which may be reusable
* extensible
* Drawing sheet formats
* Text annotations


cabling System
---------

cabling for low voltage DC apps - chargers, power supplies - Three pin plug, a 12, 5 and gnd plug (already regulated)
Handle up to 5A per socket, W=VA= 12x5 = 60W
Use PSU - Full rectifier, dual coil
Make system with lower V regulators.
Each outlet is isolated with V-regs or caps.

sell adaptors connecting the cabling system for Nokia+other phones, LCD Monitors, Gameboy(advance) etc.

Version with LED indicators, power monitoring and basic version.

Socket -
12v 5v gnd

Three pin, rounded oval cover, polarising tab. 12V

Licensing
---------
make first 3 years royalty free, subject to license, then publish spec - Take 1% royalties for HW co's to use it, or release leads for system manufacturers.
Make PCB mounted sockets for the leads for a straight socket to system interface.
Plugs - leads go from socket to plug, easily extended.
--
make high-end version for racks, with multiple redundancy and system for live interchange. System for live addition of compatible UPS systems.
Implications of DC voltage network
----------------------------------
What would a regulated DC v.net mean in a large office building?
considering power usage, stability, interference, attenuation and fluctuation as well as cable routing costs? System must easily plug into existing setup.
Make PC PSU break out boxes powered by one or more of these sockets tied together (for larger power requirements).
Say goodbye to the wall wart.
