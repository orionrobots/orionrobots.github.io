## Design

- Twin motor buggy with steering
- Build a remote for the kids – with three long cables, and a DPAD like controller
- Left/Right buttons are on resistors

- Tap forward to move forward
- When moving forward – tap reverse once to stop, again to reverse
- When reversing, tap forward to stop, again to go forward

Steering – one motor will power down to turn the robot around in the other direction.

## Basic Rules

- You must work as a team
- The left motor must be on A
- The right on B
- The vehicle must mount the RCX
- Ports 1,2,3 must be kept free for the remote to plug in

## Build Time

You will have 2 hours to complete the mission.
Time extensions are allowed if I see you to be struggling – but there is a 2 point bonus for keeping within time, and 5 point bonus if you complete the building in less than one hour.

After building – all non-used pieces must be returned and put away – remember – the better they are stored- the easier they will be to find next time. I will be doing a big piece sort at around 1am on Sunday – members are welcome to join me, and can gain 2 additional points for doing so, as well as improving their chances in challenges by being more aware of what pieces are available and where they are stored.

## Teamwork

The team may allocate a captain.
Individual points will be awarded for teamwork and co-operation – those seen not to be participating will not receive points.

## Course Navigation

Team points will be awarded for navigating through a course in the set time limit.
You will be allowed three runs. We will take the best run and use that for the time.
A different navigator may be chosen by the team for each run.
The course will have a number of obstacles- including ramps, a few turns and a narrow space with bollards. There will be a 20 second penalty for any bollards knocked over.

## Course Time Scoring

Timing         | Points
-------------- | --------
Under 10 mins  | 1 point
Under 5 Mins   | 2 Points
Under 3 Mins   | 3 points
Under 2 mins   | 5 points
Under 1 minute | 0 points

## Weight

This will be done using the kitchen scales. The remote connections will be removed for this, and the weight of the RCX and 2 motors deducted for scoring.

RCX + 2 motors –262g

Weight         | Points
-------------- | --------
Less than 500g | 1 point
Less than 400g | 2 points
300g           | 3 points
250            | 4
200            | 5
100            | 6

You will get 1 extra point for every 25g’s below 100.

## Drop Test

The RCX and Motors will be removed for the drop test – take this into account during building.
Above 3 drops – 3 points
One team point for each drop past that. We will stop at 7.

## CAD

At the end of the session, after the tests – you may as a team start to put the model into the computer (and over the following week). This will earn each participating in putting it in 5 points, and you will be able to put your model on the internet!

## Piece count

This will be taken after you input the model into the cad package – if you choose not to, then you will not be able to earn points in this category.

Pieces     | Points
---------- | -------
200 Pieces | 1 point
150        | 2
100        | 3
75         | 4
50         | 5

## Course Design

Will use a nice long straight on the corridor.
Place 3 bollards. 1 DVD case flat on the floor, 2 DVD cases either side of another propping them, 2 DVD cases either side of a Lego storage case.
