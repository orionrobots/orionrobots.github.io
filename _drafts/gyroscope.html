A couple of weeks ago, I had an <a href="../">Explorer One robot running with an HC-06 bluetooth module</a> in such a way that I could remote control it from my phone

I recently purcahsed a Gyroscope module on eBay - with a view to interfacing it with the Explorer 1 Robot kit, and placing the same type on the shop once I had it all working.

- Structure
  - The stuff with the Arrow keys/bluetooth - the fact that I spotted the veer - no odometry
  - Bought it on eBay 
  - Got it home - downloaded what I thought was the right library - nothing...
  - Tried using a USB-I2C debugger.
  - Stared at the datasheet
  - Tried many things - including reversing data and clock lines...
  - Then got the schematic/pcb and started measuring voltages - and then noticed the components were off..
  - Had I bought myself a non functional ebay fake? Go back - check the place I bought it - and bang - it was actually a different model...
  - the fact that there are two similar models - and how to identify them
  - Worked like a treat with the Arduino as soon as I had the right library with the right device addresses.
  - Biggest mistake - assuming that there was only one model by this name and not subtely different ones.
  - Plan to carry on - actually seeing if it can measure the veer.
  - Building a simple step-by-step guide to get it working.
