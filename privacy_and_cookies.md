In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and share your details where needed for them to perform the services they provide to us.

However, some third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment order processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the detail we must share with them related to your order.  We recommend that you read their privacy policies to see how they will handle your details.

Some providers may work in or be based in places with other laws than you or us. If you choose to buy when it involves the services of a third-party, then your details may be subject to the laws of the places where that service provider or its facilities are.

For example, if you are in Canada and a payment gateway in the US is used for your order, then your information used in finishing that order may be subject to sharing under United States laws like the Patriot Act.
