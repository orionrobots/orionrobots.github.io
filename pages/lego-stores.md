* [BrickLink](http://bricklink.com) Bricklink is a user driven marketplace for buying and selling Lego kits and parts. If you have a specific Lego part you want to buy many of, or a kit you are trying to find, this may be a better bet than Ebay. You will be trading with people who are also Lego enthusiasts. However - it can be a pricey way to buy Lego, and make sure you are clear where the parts are coming from and their condition.
* Ebay - If you want classic kits, bulk Lego stuff then take a look on eBay. However - as always with eBay make sure you read the sale description clearly. Make sure you know what box it is in, if all the parts are present. If you are buying bulk job lot Lego, make sure you know how much is real Lego so you aren't surprised by clone brand parts. Make sure you know where it has come from.
* Because Amazon often have big stocks, you will find popular models from previous years for sale still new on Amazon - however, Amazon are aware of this and may charge a premium for them compared with their original price. Of course Amazon is also great for Lego books too.
