Further to my recent announcements about the publication of my book, [Learn Robotics Programming second edition](http://packt.live/2XccaKe) I have made a video talking about the books features, showing demonstrations of the robot you'll build in action.

This is the second best place to see that Raspberry Pi based Python3 robot tracking and following coloured objects, tracking faces, sonar scans, avoiding obstacles and driven from a phone.

The first best place is to buy the book and build one yourself! Where you'll be able to do speech recognition, driving fixed distances, line following and more.
