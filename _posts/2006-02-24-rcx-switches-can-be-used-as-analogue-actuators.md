Even though I have used the RCX for many years, there are still new things I am learning about it.

In a recent discussion on lugnet.robotics, the original touch sensors for the RCX are revealed as not being entirely [binary](/wiki/binary.html) but actually having an analogue range of values. This in an interesting development. It may be that this is simply an accident caused by the switches manufacture, and that it should be just on or off, but Philo (Phillipe Hurbaine) has actually put together an experiment to test its sensitivity.

This test allowed Philo to gain fine control of the placement of the threaded axle. Note there is a manual handle, linked to one worm gear, which turns a pinion (8t gear) which is linked to a further worm gear, giving a massive gear reduction. While this may allow fine control - at this level of granularity, gear lash (the amount of "play" you have between the gears where the teeth do not entirely meet) can be a major problem.
