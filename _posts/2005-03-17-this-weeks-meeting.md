We are continuing the Great Ball Contraption Modules challenge. I will be announcing the final deadline for this on saturday.

I am looking for at least one of the teams to finish a module - and the first team will get a prize. Following that, I will be judging the overall winner on the following criteria:

* Technical - There will be points for showing technical skill, the use of pneumatics, or sensors, or simply a very good mechanical design will win points in this category
* Style - The model has to look good - the way the balls move should show off a bit of fun, and exposed technical workings are exactly what we want to see, as well as generally well placed style pieces giving the module a bit of a theme
* Theme - Following that - there will be points if a team can make a module that is seriously themed
* Low motor count - I will give lots of points if you can run it on one motor.
* Low Piece count - While sometimes big is beautiful, we also believe in keeping it simple - if there are two models with similar characteristics, the one with fewer pieces will get additional points
* Low weight - I will be weighing the entries - this really is a similar criteria to piece count, but now the kind of pieces are important too.

The teams have already been allocated, and we have one group using the [Lego RCX](Lego+RCX "The Lego RCX") and another using the Lego Cybermaster. There may also be a [SpyBotics](SpyBotics "Lego Programmable robot kits") based module. This seems overkill - as a team may get the whole thing working on a single motor and battery box- which is great.

So, I hope to see you all there - have fun, and keep it simple. Remember the modules we saw with Steve Hassenplugs team, and Philo's modules - this is what we are aiming for.
