title: Sounds great on the NXT
---
 <p>
  John Hansen, an avid
  [Lugnet](Lugnet "Lego Users Group Network")
  and
  [Lego](Lego "The best known construction toy")
  user has created a whole raft of top utilities for converting audio files to formats that can be used on the
  [NXT](NXT "Legos NeXT generation robotics kit")
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Whats more, they are open source, and hosted with the Bricxcc
  suite of tools.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among them are tools to convert a midi file to an
  [NXT](NXT "Legos NeXT generation robotics kit")
  melody file with the .rmd extension, which can be renamed to rso files to be played back on the
  [NXT](NXT "Legos NeXT generation robotics kit")
  . This, alongside a tool to convert wav files to rso files, and a tool to play back the rmd files makes for a good sound suite.
 </p>
 <p>
  These utilities add to an already neat set of
  [OSS](OpenSourceOSS "Open Source Software")
  tools, like BrickTool - which can deal with both the
  [RCX](RCX "The Lego Robot Command Explorer")
  and
  [NXT](NXT "Legos NeXT generation robotics kit")
  , NeXTTool which is a suite designed for communicating with the
  [NXT](NXT "Legos NeXT generation robotics kit")
  via Fantom and of course the Bricxcc Lego developer
  [IDE](IDETool "Integrated Development Environment")
  itself.
