title: Building a Microbit Robot with the Kitronic v2 Motor Board
---
In my previous post, I mentioned getting the <a href="https://twitter.com/Kitronik">Kitronic</a> V2 motor board for 
Helena to use with her microbit along with other goodies from <a href="https://twitter.com/pimoroni">Pimoroni</a>.

We've made a video where I introduce it to Helena and we build a robot with it, and write some starting code for it with python.
