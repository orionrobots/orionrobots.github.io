title: Lugnet NXT Newsgroup established
layout: post
---
For fans of the [Lego](Lego "The best known construction toy") [NXT](NXT "Legos NeXT generation robotics kit"), they will be pleased to hear that a newsgroup has been created specifically for it on [Lugnet](Lugnet "Lego Users Group Network"), which means it can be read on the web, as a mailing list, or with a normal newsgroup client.

This also means that the normal robotics list may be less drowned out by the huge amount of [NXT](NXT "Legos NeXT generation robotics kit") conversation going on right now, although much of it may be cross-posted anyway. Hopefully, while the [NXT](NXT "Legos NeXT generation robotics kit") is technically superior, the [RCX](RCX "The Lego Robot Command Explorer") will not be forgotten totally.
