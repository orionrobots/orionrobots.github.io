title: Lugnet NXT Newsgroup established

For fans of the [Lego](Lego "The best known construction toy") NXT, they will be pleased to hear that a newsgroup has been created specifically for it on Lugnet, which means it can be read on the web, as a mailing list, or with a normal newsgroup client.

This also means that the normal robotics list may be less drowned out by the huge amount of NXT conversation going on right now, although much of it may be cross-posted anyway. Hopefully, while the NXT is technically superior, the [RCX](RCX "The Lego Robot Command Explorer") will not be forgotten totally.
