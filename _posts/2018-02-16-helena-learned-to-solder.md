## Helena Learning To Solder

I started a live video session, still working on Lee Lipinski's CNC Spindle Motor board.

After I had soldered the 3 pins on this, Helena asked to have a try. She built up the Slice of Pi/IO board - an I2C based IO expander for the Raspberry Pi (and usable with other devices).

What can I say - she surprised me when she learned so quickly to make pretty neat soldering joints. I guess when there is more soldering to be done, she can be counted as part of my team!
