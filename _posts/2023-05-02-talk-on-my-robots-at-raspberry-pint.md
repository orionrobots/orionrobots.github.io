Last week, I made a live talk about the robots in my lab, showing each one and discussing difficulties along with how I would improve each of them. I show where each has further areas to work on, what I've learned so far from each. These robots include Raspberry Pis, Raspberry Pi Pico's, Arduino's, and ESP8266s. There's a hexapod, a buggy with an arm on board, my various PiWars entries, and more. This was also recorded from my new lab.

The talk was recorded and is available on YouTube:

This included my early robots from 2009, right up to the robots build for the [Robotics at Home with Raspberry Pi Pico book](https://packt.link/5swS2).

Raspberry Pint is a London based group who meet to discuss Raspberry Pi, Pico, Arduino and similar projects over a beer. Usually speakers present their projects and then open the floor to Q & A.
