Inspired by twitter user Jarkman, I decided to start making a mini portable robot toolkit.

Jarkman is a robot builder I’ve been following on twitter and met up with at EMFCamp. I’d seen his robot toolkit at https://jarkman.co.uk/catalog/robots/robottoolkit.htm and was inspired to make my own.

At EMFCamp he showed me the kit, and how he’d updated it. Other robot builders had some similar kits. Now I usually bring a small bundle of tools, but this was definitely the way to go.

This is my starting point. I’ll post more videos and pictures as I get it together.

Today is also Piwars 2022 - Old MacDoofus Had a Farm! Visit piwars.org to see what the Raspberry Pi robotics community are up to in the UK. Some awesome challenges robotic agriculture. 

I will be updating with more videos as I figure out more parts for it and fit them.
