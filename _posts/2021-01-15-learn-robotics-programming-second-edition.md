Hello, I've some great news.

On February 12th, 2021, Learn Robotics Programming 2nd Edition will be released and is now on pre-order!

[![Learn robotics Programming 2nd Edition Cover](/galleries/learn-robotics-programming-2nd-edition/learn-robotics-programming-2nd-cover.jpg)](http://packt.live/2XccaKe)

This is a step-by-step guide to building a #RaspberryPi #python #robot. Pick up #robotics fundamentals.

Get into more advanced robotics with Inertial Measurement Units (compass and orientation) - this robot knows which way is up. 

Use sensors to avoid objects and detect how far the robot has travelled. Control a robot with your phone and see through its camera. 

All done in python on the Raspberry Pi.
Build a voice agent to control the robot. Interact using an #OpenCV enabled camera for face recognition, colored object tracking and line following.
