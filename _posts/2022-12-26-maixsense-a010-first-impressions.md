T﻿he Sipeed Maixsense A010 is a 200x200 depth camera/sensor - using optical time-of-flight (TOFL) to get a picture that represents a depth field view of a room. This is a pretty exciting idea to me - it's inexpensive (less than £100), solid state - not spinning, and small.

I﻿t should also work with visual processing techniques if the output is a 2D field like a camera. Although it arrived a while ago, I gave myself a small break from my obligations (it's Christmas) to play with it. 

S﻿o far when I connect it, I do not get an image on it's screen, however, there is a serial port. The two buttons are not doing a lot yet. I did once see the Sipeed logo on the screen, but not on subsequent power ups - so that is a bit odd.

W﻿hen I connect it to the

My thought is to connect to this port and try and send commands/get data. I'll start with just the Mac, then later try it on a Raspberry Pi 4. I've a couple of robots to try it on after that.
