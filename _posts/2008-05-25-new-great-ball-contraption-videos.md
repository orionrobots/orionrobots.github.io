Just a quick note to let users now that Steve Hassenplug has uploaded a set of videos of a [Great Ball Contraption](/wiki/great_ball_contraption.html "Great Ball Contraption") running.

If you like [Lego](/wiki/lego.html "The best known construction toy"), helter-skelter, [automatons](/wiki/automaton.html) or just general cool and fancy gadgets - these will fascinate you. I will be adding a Great Ball Contraption= page with more info.
