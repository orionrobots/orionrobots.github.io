Among the robots I have seen, few have been the crowd pleaser that this little creature known as "Layered-X" (AKA Rayered X) developed by Asurada and shown off to a wave of applause at the Robo-One competition in Tokyo in March of this year.

You only need to see it perform here to understand why. It walks, it dances, it transforms, and its legs can become arms and vice versa. It shows a talent of engineering, and control that is definitely exceptional. All of this from something which is just a bundle of simple servos and linkages. Top stuff!
