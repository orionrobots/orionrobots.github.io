Tonight, while working on diagrams for [Robotics at Home with Raspberry Pi Pico](https://packt.link/5swS2) I've found a whole new menu of goodness built into #Inkscape for manipulating paths - use the menu paths->path effects, then click `+` and you get the following toolbox!

This will give me loads more ways to illustrate robots! <https://superuser.com/posts/1627872/revisions>

And sadly I fiddled too much and got the accursed unrecoverable internal error dialog. Save frequently...
