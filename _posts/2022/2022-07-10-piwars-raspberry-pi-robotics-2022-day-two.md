Today is day 2 of the Piwars Raspberry pi Robotics competition, with autonomous and manually driven robots by beginners, intermediate and pro robot builders. 

This year with an agricultural theme, teams are handling sheep, feeding cattle and picking apples. 

There are some amazing robots - great technical, artistic and code demonstrated. Some teams even made songs!

Teams are at home - so have made their own courses and videos of their robots attempting the different challenges.
