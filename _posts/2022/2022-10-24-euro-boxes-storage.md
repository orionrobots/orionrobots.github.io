title: Euro boxes - idea for storage
---
Storage is one those problems for those learning robotics at home - where to put all the bits of different sizes. You need tiny little boxes for components like electronics, larger ones to contain and transport robots.

I've recently come across euro boxes (euro crates?). They're a standard size, and can be stacked. I'm thinking of using them for storage of electronics, Lego, fastenings and so on. I'm going to try and get some, and see how they work out.

They come in transparent, or cages or opaque styles, and are made by multiple manufacturers. These might be a great alternative to the "Really Useful Boxes" I've been using for years. The Euro box sizes divide by two much like the A-series paper sizes, so they can stack in multiple configurations.

The company Solent Plastics stock these, but are not alone in doing so.
