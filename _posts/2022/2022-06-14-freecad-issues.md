My upcoming book on Pico robotics has a section on FreeCAD, and I've been using it to make the parts for the book.
This week I have been going to some lengths to dodge the FreeCAD topological naming issue.

My current strategy is using a set of main sketches and building the bodies from there, but it's pretty inconvenient.

The Youtube video below explains the issue well.

## Robotics at Home with Raspberry Pi Pico

This post was based on research I did for the book [Robotics at Home with Raspberry Pi Pico](https://packt.link/5swS2) which is available now.
