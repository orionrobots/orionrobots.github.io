This weekend, I got an optical laser based distance sensors or two working with the Raspberry Pi Pico with Micropython. I managed to get a single one working, after some frustration with the XSHUT pin, and then I managed to get 2 of the devices working. Some GPIO trickery with the XSHUT pin, and there are multiple VL53L0x sensors working.

First I got them working on 2 separate i2c buses, and then both running on a single bus. A pair of these will be perfect on my next robot build.

## Robotics at Home with Raspberry Pi Pico

This post was based on research I did for the book [Robotics at Home with Raspberry Pi Pico](https://packt.link/5swS2) which is available now.
