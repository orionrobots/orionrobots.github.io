📕Today my new book "Robotics at Home with Raspberry Pi Pico" is out 🎉! The last year and a half of work, with research into Raspberry Pi Pico PIO, hand tool chassis build techniques, probability and Monte Carlo has finally paid off with the book available.

You can buy this now on Amazon! 👉 <https://packt.link/5swS2>.

The book has been possible with the support of my wife, contributions from Leo my tech reviewer and the PacktPub team.

Here's what you'll learn from Robotics at Home with Raspberry Pi Pico:

- 💡 Planning a robot around Raspberry Pi Pico
- 💡 Using FreeCAD to design a robot chassis
- 💡 Using hand tools to cut a chassis and assemble a robot around it
- 💡 Soldering headers onto parts
- 💡 Programming Raspberry Pi Pico in CircuitPython
- 💡 Interacting with quadrature encoders
- 💡 Programming Raspberry Pi Pico PIO
- 💡 The PID algorithm
- 💡 Wall avoiding with VL53L1X distance sensors
- 💡 Adding Bluetooth BLE to a robot
- 💡 Graphing data from a robot on a smartphone
- 💡 Sensing orientation changes with an inertial measurement unit
- 💡 Building a robot test arena
- 💡 Estimating a robots location with the Monte Carlo Localisation algorithm
- 💡 Visualising data with matplotlib

Is this book for you?

- ❗️You would like to learn to build a robot step-by-step
- ❗️You would like to get to know the Raspberry Pi Pico
- ❗️The book assumes very basic programming knowledge
- ❗️The book assumes no prior experience with hand tools, or soldering

This is my third robotics book with Packt 🚀! The book presents a step-by-step hands on robot building and programming journey, with an extendable rover designed for experimentation and enhancement.

Buy the book in print or as an ebook at <https://packt.link/5swS2>.

## Note on the lead image

I am still to have the print version delivered. Until then, the above image will have to do. The book is a render from Blender with the texture on a correctly proportioned cuboid, and the picture composited with GIMP, the foreground selection tool for the two robots and some patience.

I'll make an updated image for a follow up article when I receive my print books!
