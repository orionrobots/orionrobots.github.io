# Live video Item

Last night Helena and I made a live video fixing the Spindle motor control board for viewer Lee Lipinski's CnC mill - a machine almost (but not quite) identical to mine.

Helena has lots of questions about soldering, and hasn't seen much of it before, so I included her while making the video - she also kept an eye on the chat window for me and is pretty good at asking what I am doing.

Towards the end of the video I was asked about how I used the Arduino in my CnC control box and went into detail.

# Site Improvement 

Today I figured out how to put a tag cloud on the site - to help people find their way around. There is actually quite a lot of stuff here - but some of it is well buried. Content has been here since 2002, and some it definitely needs revising and curating.
