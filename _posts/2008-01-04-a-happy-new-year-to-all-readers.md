I hope all the OrionRobots readers have had a great holiday and wish you all a Happy 2008.

OrionRobots has (as you may have noticed) undergone a few small site upgrades, and I will be expecting to deliver more of those this year as well as more good content. It should be an interesting and exciting year indeed.

Please feel free to register and leave your comments. I would like to hear more from the readers.
