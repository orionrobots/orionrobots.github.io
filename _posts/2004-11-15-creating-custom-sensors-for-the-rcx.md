The process of making your own homegrown sensors for the Lego RCX is not only possible, but a well-documented and well-walked path.

[Interfacing with Stud Based Lego Electronic Adaptors](/wiki/adapting_lego_connectors.html)

There are two main types active and passive. You need to choose which type of sensor you will require fairly early in your design.

# Passive Sensors

A simple sensor like a touch sensor or variable resistance type of sensor.


For passive sensors - you simply need to construct the right connectors. Other than that- you may want to use a combination of resistors to scale and calibrate your sensor.

# Active Sensors

An active sensor actually requires power for IC's and intelligent circuits. As such they are somewhat more complex to build. 

The Lego RCX sensor pads have only 2 connections. In the passive sensor - one is the sensor input, and the other the output, but you cannot get a constant voltage - as you require power, ground and signal connectors. What the RCX does is to use one line for both power, and signal - by alternating rapidly between the two uses.

You will need a capacitor to store power, and an output channel going back down the power channel between phases.

The best explanation is probably at <http://www.philohome.com/sensors/legorot.htm>.
