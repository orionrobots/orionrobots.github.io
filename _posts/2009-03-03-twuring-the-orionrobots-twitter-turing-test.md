<p>
Okay, I am now well involved in the phenomenon that is twitter, and for those interested it is
<a href="http://twitter.com/orionrobots" >Twitter</a>
</p>
<p>
I have been thinking about AI's and chatbots for twitter and will be figuring out which I can adapt myself. However, there are plenty of clever tweeps out there who might be able to code their own or adapt something.
<br/>
Bring out your Twitter AI's! If you simply pipe twitter to Alice or Eliza, or even Psychoanalyze-pinhead, code your own complete AI, dust off and bring out NIALL then I want to know here.
</p>
<p>
So here - put your best twitter chat bot forward - a link to twitter to follow, as a comment, and tell us a little about how it is written. I will be getting people to test it from around the twitterverse (is that a word?) at silly hours of the day, to ensure it really is a bot (it may be hard to prove this bit).
</p>
<p>
So go on - give us your best, chattiest bot - I want to hear from you. Let the OrionRobots Twitter Turing Test Begin!
For those who want a short name, I am thinking Twuring!
</p>
<p>
Rules:
<ul>
<li>
 Must be on twitter - with its own profile.
</li>
<li>
 Twitter profile should state it is a bot, and an entry to twuring.
</li>
<li>
 Be prepared to tell us a little of how you did it (enough to prove it is a bot and not a fake) - a link to a blog/article about how you did it would be good.
</li>
</ul>
