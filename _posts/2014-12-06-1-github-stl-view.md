title: Github's awesome stl view

So first some great news.
Today I've received a Reprap pro Ormerod 2 3d printer kit!
This will be my first 3D printer, and I will be assembling it over the coming few days or weeks.
It is not something I will rush!
As for the CNC, until I sort out a better dust control system for milling foam and MDF it is currently not doing a lot.

While following the assembly instructions for this kit, at the earliest part, it has a click through to the STL file in github.
STL files are a common format for 3d printing, and are also used for CNC milling.
What I did not know is that github has a built in STL viewer!
This is absolutely awesome.
Github continues to surprise and delight me.
Perhaps I should (if I ever have time) try to contribute a Lego LDraw viewer to github.

What is also awesome is that with not a lot of code, this STL preview can be embedded right into a page.
That includes a github hosted jekyll page as shown below.
