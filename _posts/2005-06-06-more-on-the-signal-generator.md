# Signal Generator build

![]({{page.gal}}/258-workshop.jpg)

When I build the Diode bridge - I needed to generate signals to test it. This is how I build the Signal Generator I used to test them.

I managed to get the cavities for the system drilled into the case that came with the velleman amp kit. It was a bit awkward - the material the case is made out of is thin, and tends to split when drilled at all but the lowest speed setting. Equally, the material is hard to clamp effectively so it either cant be held firmly, or it splits.

When designing it, I did not manage to find all the dimensions for the socket parts, so I simply measured them up, and put holes to mount them in the CAD design. Once it all works, I will post the design here.

The DC power supply hole was an awkward shaped one - an elongated D with two small screw holes either side (a little too close). It required a fair amount of time with a Dremel, and then some elbow grease with a set of needle files to get it right. If you are going to attempt this yourself - be warned, that was the part I found most awkward. I am still debating on how I will mount the boards inside it.

# Freeform Diode Rectifier

I've freeformed a diode bridge to test this signal generator with, and with the intent of embedding in a Lego brick.

The intended result will look like this:

Here are pictures of construction of this project.

I am still yet to write it up, and may have to build and photograph another.

I intend to thoroughly test it with the signal generator once I have built it and it would be a good object to test with it to demonstrate both builds.
