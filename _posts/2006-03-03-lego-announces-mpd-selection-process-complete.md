title: Lego announces MPD selection process complete

[Lego](/wiki/lego) have now issued a press release today, stating that they have now finished the
[MDP](/wiki/mdp "The Mindstorms Developer Panel") selection process for the [Mindstorms](/wiki/mindstorms "A Robotic construction toy system from Lego") [NXT](/wiki/nxt "Legos NeXT generation robotics kit").

They also announced the number of applicants, which is in excess of 9600 people worldwide- a much larger figure than my estimated 5000 earlier today. Apparently this cross section was aged from 18-75, with a majority under 35. There was a significant representation of people from the software industry, as well as academics, a smaller group of architects and engineers. Also, while the group is worldwide, there is a significant representation of the US in the MDP selection. This group will extend upon the existing members of the more tight-lipped [MUP](/wiki/mup "Mindstorms User Panel") team.
