One of the things occurring in modern robotics is that they are increasingly being used to wage in wars by the richest nations. This benefits them in not having to sacrifice men on the front line, as well as being able to send robots for painstaking sweeping/searching missions where the robot will spot things a person may not be able to see.

They may even be manned from a distance, flown or driven remotely.

It is a double edged sword, as while I am no fan of killing machines, or warfare in general, if it must be done, doing it without putting people in the front line might be better. Could this develop into SkyNet? Unlikely and very improbable.
