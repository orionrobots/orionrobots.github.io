# Intro 

At Orionrobots I have a 3D printer and should be able to use others for builds my printer can't handle.
I've been collecting a list of items I want to 3D print. I've decided to make that list public.
Consider this post a changing list - it will change. I'll update it as we find awesome stuff to try, and then when we've actually done so and made a post or pictures on it.

## Stuff We want to print

* ON twitter - user @KariLawler showed a 3D printed Ready Player 1 Marble maze. This would be fun to print. https://twitter.com/KariLawler/status/973652674276143109?t=1&cn=ZmxleGlibGVfcmVjcw%3D%3D&refsrc=email&iid=763ecab1a9a94a4b8600e2a6c959e4de&uid=1251125814&nid=244+293670929 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4awC9WRtNw
