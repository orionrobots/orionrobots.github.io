Electronic machines have played a part in music for around half a century now, although this has mostly been in the form of synthesizers, electronic effects modules and the like. Some have been completely electronic instruments - like the awesome Eigenharp, the sci-fi classic soundtrack of a theremin and the slightly embarrassing Stylophone.

However, I've seen very few attempts to combine robot and acoustic instruments. And up until today - I'd not seen a robotic rock/metal band.

I introduce [CompressorHeads](http://www.compressorheadband.com/) - performing The Ace of Spades:
