I have contributed to a feature published this month in The Magpi - the Raspberry Pi Magazine. In it I show how to use a Raspberry Pi Pico with a MeArm robot arm, and use Micropython to program a web controlled robot with step record and playback capabilities

This is the process I used for [MeArm Robot Arm with Pico - Record and Playback]({% post_url 2023-06-05-mearm-robot-arm-with-pico-recorded-actions %}) and [Two MeArm Robot Arms Play Pass-the-parcel]({% post_url 2023-06-12-mearm-robot-two-arms-pass-the-parcel %}).

As well as my robot arm fun, there's plenty of other awesome Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi Pico things, like making game engines and using the Camera Module.
