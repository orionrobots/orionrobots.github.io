## Meeting Log

This weeks meeting ended up being just myself and Dale.
However - since it was a very sunny day, we decided to go out on the green, and sketch Lego Mindstorms concepts for robots and ball contraptions, and the new Lego RCX pneumatic valve design I am considering.
All in all - a very pleasant meeting.

I cant say any more on the valve design - only that it may solve the [solenoid](/wiki/solenoid.html "Solenoid") problem for many.
