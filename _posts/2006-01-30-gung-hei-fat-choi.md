Well first - I would like to say Gung Hei Fat Choi, that is, Happy Chinese New Year.
You may have noticed things are a bit slow on OrionRobots at the moment, this is because I am preparing for a new phase with a better looking design, new features and in preparation for some changes.
We will be considering our hosting setup, for which a number of options have presented themselves, and we may even alter the underlying CMS software.

I also watched, with some fun, the Iron Mecha competition on [Lugnet.mecha](http://news.lugnet.com/build/mecha).

I am waiting, with anticipation, who will be in the 100 lucky [Lego](/wiki/lego "The best known construction toy") people who will be in the extended [Mindstorms](/wiki/mindstorms "A Robotic construction toy system from Lego") Developers Panel (MDP).
I do not know what my chances are, but I would certainly be honoured to be part of it.
Good luck to all those who have hopefully applied for this.

The NXT is most definitely a welcome addition to the wealth of robot kits and devices in the hobby.
Meanwhile, there has been some investigation of the use of bluetooth with the [ooPIC](/wiki/oopic.html "OOPic").
Maybe using an [I2C](/wiki/i2c "Inter Integrated Circuit bus") based [bluetooth](/wiki/bluetooth "Bluetooth") adaptor, then the ooPIC and the NXT could be combined.
There are those who are already looking to put an [IR](/wiki/infra_red "Acronym for Infra Red") serial port to Bluetooth adaptor as well, so the NXT and the [RCX](/wiki/lego_rcx "The Lego RCX") have a chance of working together.
