I've been spending far more time with Arduino based robots, and far less time with Lego, but I have been wondering about interfacing the Arduino, with it's many interfacing capabilities, with Lego.

I used Lego Digital Designer to create an Arduino holder in Lego.

Note the technic pins on the side, and the hole for USB.

While the design in CAD uses color coded sections, I build the real one using whatever parts I could, the classic Lego way using whatever colors I had to hand.

The Arduino fits snugly, and the USB port is accessible.
