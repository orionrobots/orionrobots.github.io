I was sent a link to a GitHub repository with a number of robotics algorithms implemented in Python.[PythonRobotics](https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics/tree/master)

They are Open source, with an MIT license and reasonably well documented and tested. They also have a reduced set of dependencies like NumPy and SciPy.

In the algorithms are SLAM, A* and D* path planning, Particle filter localisation, grid mapping to name a few. This is a great resource for robot builders!
