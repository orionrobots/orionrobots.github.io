description: Robotics touch sensors mimicking human fingerprints
---
Today, I came across a [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-42722-4 "A robotic sensory system with high spatiotemporal resolution for texture recognition") detailing some interesting robotics sensor technology.

This uses high precision 3D printing with capacitive/conductive gel moulded into it to make "fingerprints" with the tiny ridge like structures that give our fingertips so much sensitivity.

They've measured and processed this through an STM microcontroller, with python running on a computer to further process and visualise the data.

The paper has [code in github](https://github.com/Billy1203/SUSTech-texture-recognition) and in the [supplementary documentation](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-023-42722-4/MediaObjects/41467_2023_42722_MOESM1_ESM.pdf), there are schematics, along with the process they used to imprint the tiny ridges into the gel.
