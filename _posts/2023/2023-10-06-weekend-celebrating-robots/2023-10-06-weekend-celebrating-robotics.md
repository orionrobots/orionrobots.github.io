This weekend, we have plenty to celebrate, with robots, books and a little Prosecco.

## PiWars 2024

I am happy to announce that our team has been accepted to compete in the intermediate category in PiWars 2024! I look forward to seeing the other teams there. Now to build that robot.

The pictured robot now has ideas for a grab and lift mechanism in Lego Technic, inspired by what I'd seen in the WRO (World Robotics Olympiad) competition.

## Books sales - over 10,000 copies!

Today I went through my author publishing report, and discovered that between the 3 books - Learn Robotics Programming 1st and 2nd editions, along with Robotics at Home With Raspberry Pi Pico, I've sold over 10,000 copies!

Those will hopefully translate to 10,000+ robots built, and 10,000+ people learning about robotics and programming!

I think this is cause for celebration in our family, and I'm really grateful to everyone who has bought a copy of my books, and to everyone who has supported me in writing them.

If you've not got one, and want to learn about robotics, I'd recommend you try out [Robotics at Home With Raspberry Pi Pico](https://packt.link/5swS2) - it's a great way to get started with robotics, and you can build a low cost robot with interesting advanced behaviour, and an arena to test it with.
