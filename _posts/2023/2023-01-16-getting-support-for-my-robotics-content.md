I've written books, articles, blog posts and made youtube videos. I've decided to make a place where my community can contact me to get support, talk about these robot materials, ask me questions, give me feedback, or feed into other books and content.

You can now reach me, and this community at:
[Danny Staple Robotics Discord Server](https://discord.gg/4kcSNf4Npp).
