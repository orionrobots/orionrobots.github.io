title: Esp8266 nodemcu simple robot
---
This week I built a simple robot base using a NodeMCU V3 dev board - an ESP8266 based board broken out for use with a breadboard,
and with on board 3v voltage regulation. Since it's using the NodeMCU firmware, it can be programmed in LUA.

The robot has two motorized wheels, and a castor.

In this videeo - I get the robot going through basic modes, with simple code.

For build instructions go here:

The robot has potential - there are many unused IO pins, and I've not started seeing what I can do with wifi on it. 
I will start playing more with it for the next few videos.
