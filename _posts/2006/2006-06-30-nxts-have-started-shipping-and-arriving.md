title: NXT's have started shipping and arriving
layout: post
---
The [Lego](/wiki/lego.html "The best known construction toy") [Mindstorms](/wiki/mindstorms.html "A Robotic construction toy system from Lego") [NXT](/wiki/nxt.html "Legos NeXT generation robotics kit") kit started shipping last week and have now started arriving. However, there may be a fair backlog as all the pre-orders go out.

I am waiting rather intently for mine and maybe I will finish the Lathe I am building using the NXT as opposed to the [RCX](/wiki/rcx.html "The Lego Robot Command Explorer") + [PIC](/wiki/pic.html"PIC") combination I was originally planning - the ability to get feedback on the motors positioning may simplify its design by a huge amount.

I will be putting work in progress photos of the programmable lathe up soon, so readers can actually see what I am on about here.
