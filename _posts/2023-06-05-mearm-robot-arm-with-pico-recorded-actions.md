We've been playing recently with a MeArm Maker robot arm. Our current experiments include a Wifi enabled Raspberry Pi Pico-W version, and using a web server running on the PicoW to record arm positions, then smoothly interpolate while playing them back to create smooth motion.

The full details are to come, but until then, enjoy our Youtube footage of this in action.
