A group of guys at a tech convention (24th Annual Computer Chaos Congress) strapped together a robot from all kinds of odds and ends - a Chumby (a small Linux based cute and fluffy computing thing), a DVB-T (the same system as UK's Freeview) transceiver kit and encoder, an RC car, some phidgets and a bunch of other stuff. All of the guys at the convention just happened to have the right kit to put it together - and the thing may not be a beauty, but it is definitely pretty cool.
