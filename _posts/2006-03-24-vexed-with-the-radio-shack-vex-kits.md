I have recently been informed that the rather fantastic (but expensive) Radio Shack VEX may about to be discontinued, and as a result, is actually being sold at half price discounts on the Radio Shack website.

If you don't know what the VeX is, it is like the [Lego](/wiki/lego "The best known construction toy") [Mindstorms](/wiki/mindstorms "A Robotic construction toy system from Lego") [RIS](RIS "The Lego Robotic Invention System"), but with Meccano like (that's Erector to US readers) pieces, a much more extensible and flexible.
