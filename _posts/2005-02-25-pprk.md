This kit allows you to build a robot using a Palm Pilot or one of its compatible derivatives. It may not work with the newest Palm Computers and [PDAs](/wiki/personal_data_assistant.html "Personal Data Assistant") as the ports are different.

This is a university project. [PPRK Home]()

It uses [Holonomic Wheels](/wiki/holonomic_wheels.html "Holonomic Wheels") (Omni-Wheels). Use the kit with a [Palm Computer](/wiki/palm_computer.html "Palm Computer") PDA and you have a touch sensitive, gui LCD screen and controller straight off. It comes also with 3 optical sensors.

You can buy the kit at [Acroname](https://acroname.com). They include hardware and software. The instruction to scratch build it are also available at [Its Home Page](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pprk/).

The kit requires some soldering, and glueing.
