 <p>
  I have come across another interesting
  [NXT](NXT "Legos NeXT generation robotics kit")
  blog at
  <a href="http://thenxtstep.blogspot.com/" >
   http://thenxtstep.blogspot.com/
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  It is updated regularly, and has made a number of interesting observations about the kit and bot itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  I will certainly be reading it, and of very great interest is the most recent announcement:
  <a href="http://thenxtstep.blogspot.com/2006/03/back-from-vacation-and-mdp.html" >
   http://thenxtstep.blogspot.com/2006/03/back-from-vacation-and-mdp.html
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  The author, Jim K, of Atlanta, has been accepted into the
  [MDP](MDP "The Mindstorms Developer Panel")
  . So we may expect to hear much more interesting info from him. There are already a number of tasty tidbits about the system there.
 </p>
 <p>
  Coupled with
  <a href="http://legoeducation.typepad.com/" >
   http://legoeducation.typepad.com/
  </a>
  , which is an official
  [Lego](Lego "The best known construction toy")
  blog which I have referred to before, and
  <a href="http://news.lugnet.com/robotics" >
   Lugnet Robotics
  </a>
  , there is a growing surge of information, and very likely a coming surge of interest in robotics at its release as was evident with the original
  [RCX](RCX "The Lego Robot Command Explorer")
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Stayed tuned - its all about to get very much more interesting.
