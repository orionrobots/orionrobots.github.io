This weekend, the PiWars 2022 event is in full swing. Teams have submitted videos of their robots in action. All the robots are based aorund a Raspberry Pi, with school teams and home teams of different experience levels, competing with ingenious mechanisms, great design, autonomous code or manual driving. I'm really enjoying watching it!
