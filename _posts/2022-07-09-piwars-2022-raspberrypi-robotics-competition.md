This weekend, the PiWars 2022 event is in full swing. Teams have submitted videos of their robots in action. All the robots are based around a Raspberry Pi, with school teams and home teams of different experience levels, competing with ingenious mechanisms, great design, autonomous code or manual driving. I'm really enjoying watching it!

Watch the Saturday runs live stream:
