## My Plan

Ideally, I would like to drive my CNC Machine from an Arduino UNO running GRBL so I can get a lightweight, low cost solution that I can plug into a USB port on a laptop or Mac.
I know only a little to start with on grbl - but my understanding is that it is a g-code interpreter running on the Arduino, and doesn't need a lot on the PC driving it.

I know that in most cases I'll be designing my things in a CAD app, exporting to STL, then generating gCode, and this would apply on the Mach3 + windows, LinuxCNC or GRBL route.

My understanding so far on the Mach3 setup is that it would need a dedicated computer with parallel ports that is not allowed to run other apps at the same time.
[LinuxCNC](http://linuxcnc.org/) may be marginally better on performance in this way.
Somehow the Arduino version sounds tidier, and getting it working and well documented would lay down groundwork for others to follow.
