title: How does the Explorer 1 Robot Deal with Obstacles?
---
A customer recently asked if the robot would be able to drive over obstacles - like door plinths, and if it could cross gaps. The only good way to answer this was to try it out - so I did.

I used the Orion Explorer 1 Wall Avoider Kit, with wall avoider code - so it dodged and veered as the sensors picked up the floor. In hindsight, perhaps the Bluetooth kit would have been better for this, but it was more fun anyway - gave the robot a mind of its own!
