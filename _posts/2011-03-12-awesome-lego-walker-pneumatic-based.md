This guy has built a Lego walker based all on pneumatics, no electronics or programmable bricks at all. Granted, there is a likely non-Lego air compressor for it, but still. It is an amazing bit of work, and considering all I ever did with pneumatics was a simple 3 cylinder reciprocating engine, I am quite amazed. It must have taken plenty of time and quite a few attempts to get right!
