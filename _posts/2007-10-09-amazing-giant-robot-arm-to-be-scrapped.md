title: Amazing giant robot arm to be scrapped

{% include JB/setup %}

I was shown a story today about a really rather fantastic robot arm - one that is large enough (between 7 and 8 meters!), and powerful enough to crush cars. Robohand is built entirely from scrap for the Robodock 2007 festival in Amsterdam last month.

Created by a team led by Christian Ristow, this behemoth lifted vehicles under the control of spectators, and is described as granted feelings of power and awe.

What is a real shame is that it is too large, and too expensive to try to move this huge creation. So it is to be taken apart and returned back to scrap. I wander if any readers here have the resources to ensure such a device a good home?
