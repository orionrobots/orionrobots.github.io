In September 1998, hobbyist robot builders woke up the world over to robot building when the original [Lego RCX](/wiki/lego_rcx "The Lego RCX") was released. The RCX changed everything. The plastic toy of our childhood resurfaced as a leader in technology- and woke an army of [AFOLS](/wiki/afol "Adult Fan Of Lego") - adult fans of [Lego](/wiki/lego "The best known construction toy"), a completely unexpected group who were contributing, collaborating and hacking the product in ways Lego could not have dreamed of.

The Lego company watched, saw satellite businesses spring up, and even encouraged this. New sensors, devices, programming systems and even complete [OS's](/wiki/os "An Operating System") resulted. The [Lugnet Lego community](/wiki/lugnet "Lego Users Group Network") and Lego hosted discussion sites- and Lego's best selling toy went from strength to strength.

But then the company hit trouble, they lost touch with the Lugnet/AFOL community, and invested heavily in License deals. Lego produced a raft of badly received toys, and then announced that to save costs the company would rein in and focus its market again. During this time, the community rumour mill speculated, was the amazing [Mindstorms](/wiki/mindstorms "A Robotic construction toy system from Lego") to be dropped or revamped? Lego stayed silent. They released the [Spybotics](/wiki/spybotics "Lego Programmable robot kits") kits, which were interesting, but fairly limited in comparison.

During this time, the community continued to innovate, but the limitations of the [RCX](/wiki/rcx "The Lego Robot Command Explorer") were becoming well known. The RCX was too awkward to interface with, sure there were custom sensors, but it was such a task to create them. There were not enough ports, the [IR](/wiki/ir "Acronym for Infra Red") often played up, the [RCX](/wiki/rcx "The Lego Robot Command Explorer") Code system did not go down well. As result of these, massive innovation in the community continued, but frustration brewed, and people were looking at other systems. They starting considering using alternative microcontrollers with Lego, like the RCX, or those less targeted at Lego like the [OOPic](/wiki/oopic "OOPic"), but not before voicing their issues publicly.

Lego were listening, and in secrecy, quested after some of the top contributors to the community, brought them together and formed the MUP - the Mindstorms User Panel. This included Steve Hassenplug, a driving force behind the [Great Ball Contraption](/wiki/great_ball_contraption "Great Ball Contraption") efforts, from Lafayette, Indiana, along with John Barnes, David Schilling, and Ralph Hempel (who is known for his pneumatic compressor designs). Between them, and Lego's own Søren Lund, they conspired to create something amazing.

On January the 4th, at the Consumer Electronics Show 2006, Lego announced the NXT - the Next step in the Mindstorms line. The amazing NXT has rekindled the community interest, and further extends its open doors, by now looking to take on 100 volunteers, who will buy the set early at reduced price, and contribute to the total experience.
