If you are based in the UK here is an item shopping list suitable for building a robot as shown in the [Robotics at Home with Raspberry Pi Pico book]( https://packt.link/5swS2). These are made using ThePiHut, a reputable UK electronics vendor with a broad selection and Amazon. You could definitely find parts cheaper on eBay or Alibaba, however you will have longer lead times and the quality will vary.

Some parts have already been adapted to newer versions in this list.

Robot parts:

You will also need consumables. These are parts needed for the robot, but come in quantity so you will have a stock for other robot and maker projects. You may already have some of these around.

The next thing you will need are tools. You may also already have these in your home. These will be usable in other robotics projects, or are the kind of thing you'll find in a maker space or school workshops.

Finally, there is the optional part of crimping. I feel this makes the connections from the motors, batteries and UBEC neat. Crimping tools are not cheap, but this falls into tools and consumables for more projects.

Part availability and prices are changing rapidly at the moment, and hopefully some of the sensors and motors will come down in price, closer to where they were when this started.
