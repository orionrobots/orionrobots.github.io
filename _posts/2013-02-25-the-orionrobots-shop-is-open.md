We've opened up for business with some great products to kickstart a robot building hobby. At the Orionrobots Shop you can buy everything you'll need to build a robot in no time at all.

The product we are proudest of here is the <a href="http://shop.orionrobots.co.uk/products/orion-explorer-1-robot-kit" title="The Orion Explorer 1 Robot Kit">Orion Explorer 1 Kit</a> - everything a person would need to build their first robot. This includes control boards, a chassis with motors and wheels, spare cables and somewhere to put the batteries. This bundle requires no soldering to get it going, and only a computer with the internet and a standard USB cable to program it.

Sensors and separate parts are also available on the site too.

Come take a look around the store!
