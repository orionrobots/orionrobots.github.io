<p>Professor Kevin Warwick of Reading University is well known for having been involved in building a group of robots known as The Seven Dwarfs. He has some responsibility behind <a href="/wiki/cybot.html" title="Cybot">Cybot</a>.
</p>
<p>He is also infamous for trying Cybernetic Implants in himself - such as a chip to activate a door and another actually implanted to interact with his nervous system. He might aim at being the first <a href="/wiki/cyborg.html" title="Cybernetic Organism">Cyborg</a> in the Sci-Fi sense of the word, but may have been beaten to it by anyone with a mechanised heart regulator or artificial limb.
</p>
<p>His efforts have made a relatively significant contribution to <a href="/wiki/robotic.html" title="Robotic">Robotics</a>.
