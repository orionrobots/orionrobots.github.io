<p><a class="wiki" href="/wiki/helicopter.html" title="Helicopter">Helicopters</a> use a very specialised propellor in which each individual blade can be rotated and positioned as they rotate.  They take their name from the fact that the force in a Propellor or rotor is <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/helical.html" title="Helical">Helical</a> - that is spiral like.
