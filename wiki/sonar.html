<p>Sonar is a system that uses audible "pings" to bounce sounds off of objects and detect their presence,  distance or indeed their density. It is, like many technical terms, an acronym - SOund Navigation And Ranging.
</p>
<p>It is simple to use for robotics as a quick gauge of distance to an object and can be used for basic object avoidance. This method was used by the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/cybot.html" title="Cybot">Cybot</a> and a sonar module is now present in the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/nxt.html" title="Legos NeXT generation robotics kit">NXT</a>. The way it is used by robots is very rarely as sophisticated as creating a sweep of an area as you might see in a submarine movie.
</p>
<p>Sonar units may be salvaged from some of the Polaroid cameras, and also picked up from <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/maplin.html" title="Maplin">Maplin</a> as car parking sensor kits.
