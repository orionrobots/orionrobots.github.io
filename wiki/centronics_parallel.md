<p>This is the standard parallel interface on most computers. It was originally designed by the centronics group as a printer interface system.
<br/>It has now gone on to be used for scanners, removable drives, and robotics interface.  Although pretty much superceded by the <a href="/wiki/universal_serial_bus.html" title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</a> port (in a round-about way), it is one of the simplest places to connect something to your computer.
</p>
<p>I would advise optically isolating any connections - and never drawing power for more than a few <a href="/wiki/led.html" title="Light Emitting Diode">LED</a>'s from the port.
