This was the standard parallel interface on most computers in the 1990's. It was originally designed by the centronics group as a printer interface system.<br>
It has now gone on to be used for scanners, removable drives, and robotics interface. Although pretty much superceded by the [USB](/wiki/universal_serial_bus.html "Universal Serial Bus") port, it was one of the simplest places to connect something to a computer, the GPIO of the time.

I would advise optically isolating any connections - and never drawing power for more than a few [LED](/wiki/led.html "Light Emitting Diode")'s from the port.
