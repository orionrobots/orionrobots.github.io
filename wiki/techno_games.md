<p>
<br/>An event and tv show which occurs once a year(for one week).
</p>
<p>Robots and mechanical devices contend with each other in a series of competitions to perform tasks like rope climbing, rocket height, racing(wheeled and walker), obstacle courses, kicking balls and more.
</p>
<p>There are other similar event sincluding robot search and rescue competitions.
</p>
<p>We on OrionRobots hope to see more shows of this kind, and more often than once a week - though being a bit of a niche audience - it is unlikely to happen(webcast shows?).
</p>
<p>Failing that, maybe we should launch our own set of competitions for interesting robots.
