<p>This was a very famous early attempt on the Turing Test.
</p>
<p>Eliza was a talk-bot which attempted to emulate a conversation as a pyschiatrist. It would latch on to key words, and reel off programmed responses- sometimes substituting your own words. It woudl ask questions like "how do you feel about your mother?" and occasionally bring up a subject earlier in the discussion.
<br/>Recent implmentations include Alice. If you are a Unix user - Emacs has a few of these :
</p>
<ul><li> psychoanalyse - an Eliza clone which is pretty basic and faithful
</li><li> pinhead - a swearing/jive talking chatbot
</li></ul><p>
<br/>Indeed you can actually tell it to "pyschoanalyse-pinhead" and watch the swearing robot and pyscho-analysis bot chat to each other.
</p>
<p>It is not quite <a href="/wiki/artificial_intelligence.html" title="Artificial Intelligence">artificial Intelligence</a>, but can be quite amusing.
