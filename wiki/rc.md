<p>RC is commonly used as a shortcut for Remote Control.
</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to acheive this. First there is radio - aka <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/wireless.html" title="Wireless">wireless</a> - which are what most people associate with this. Next there is <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/infra_red.html" title="A type of EM radiation commonly used for digital communications">Infra Red</a> which every couch potato relies on! You can also refer to long 1 and 2 wire protocols as being remote control.
</p>
<p>Currently standards like <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/bluetooth.html" title="Bluetooth">Bluetooth</a> and Wi Fi<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: Wi Fi">?</a> are changing the face of remote control devices, and the concept of sending full streaming digital video media over the air is not so much an issue - which allows for some robots to employ a method of removed control - where a much more advanced and intelligent computer is used to direct via RC, a much smaller robot.
