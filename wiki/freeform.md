<p>Freeforming is a technique used to bild circuitss without using <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/pcb.html" title="Printed Circuit Board">PCBs</a>. <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/mark_tilden.html" title="Mark Tilden">Mark Tilden</a> has used this technique, and it is used extensively in <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/beam_robots.html" title="Biology, Electronics, Aesthetics and Mechanics">BEAM Robots</a>.
</p>
<p>Pros:
</p>
<ul><li> Small - Freeform circuits tend to allow you to squeeze components into a very small space.
</li><li> Lightweight - Without the copper clad/stripboard and all of its stuff - you get a much lighter board
</li><li> Cheap - You dont need to buy boards, or PCB kits, or pay for expensive PCB prototyping
</li><li> Quick - Again - without the need for prototyping, or planning matrix boards, it is a lot quicker to freeform
</li></ul><p>Cons:
</p>
<ul><li> Difficult - requires practice and good technique. You really need to be able to visualise.
</li><li> Not easily maintained - you cannot easily replace a faulty component- make sure you test them first and take care when soldering.
</li></ul><p>
<br/>Freeforming usually means taking the bare components, bending, trimming and soldering leads together.

<h1  id="What_do_you_need">What do you need</h1>
<p>You will require a good <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/robot_tools.html" title="Tools that are often required to get started in robot building">Toolset</a> including:
</p>
<ul><li> Decent soldering iron
</li><li> Long nosed pliers
</li><li> Wire cutters
</li><li> Quick setting glue
</li></ul><p>
<br/>Now - following our <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/robot_building_safety.html" title="Building robots can be dangerous - tips to help your safety">Safety Guide</a>- you should also have the following:
</p>
<ul><li> Good surface/soldering mat
</li><li> Goggles (this is where you are quite likely to have small bits of wire fly up and hit you in the face as you cut them)
</li><li> Good lighting
</li><li> No interruptions (burnt fingers are bad!)
</li></ul><p>
<br/>Recommended:
</p>
<ul><li> Helping hands (the mini adjustable clamp variety) - to hold bits you dont have enough hands for
</li><li> <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/multimeter.html" title="MultiMeter">MultiMeter</a> - Try to ensure you have tested the components before you solder them in
</li></ul><p>
<br/>You also need a lot of patience, and I seriously do not recommend doing this while tired.

<p>It is also worth having a back of push in connectors. The reason for this is that you can freeform modules of circuits, and join them with jump wires. While this may add a little size and weight to a freeform, it will still be less than a PCB equivalent.

<h1  id="Planning_a_freeform">Planning a freeform</h1>
<p>First be aware of the circuit you are using. Take each of the components, and judge the size and shape. Think about how many input/output connections the circuit needs. It is usually a good idea to have most IO connections facing the right way. Once you have all of these - then it is a matter of inspiration. For each idea, sketch it out (which is difficult because these tend to be more '3D' than PCB circuits) and trace the pathways - make sure all the correct connections are there. Try to limit risks of leads that shouldnt be touching accidentally doing so. This may mean glueing a peice of paper between them.
