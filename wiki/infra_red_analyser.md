<p>There are a number of devices capable of analysing <a href="/wiki/infra_red.html" title="A type of EM radiation commonly used for digital communications">Infra Red</a> communications.
<br/>The most simple are an <a href="/wiki/oscilloscope.html" title="Systems designed to view voltage/current over time">Oscilloscope</a> with a phototransistor - and a little circuitry, right up to complex protocol analysers, which can analyse the timing, the baud rate - and shift in the data to registers.
</p>
<p>All <a href="/wiki/infra_red.html" title="A type of EM radiation commonly used for digital communications">Infra Red</a> devices are digital <a href="/wiki/serial_data_stream.html" title="Serial Data Stream">serial</a> devices, which simplifies things somewhat.
</p>
<p>If you want some makeshift detection just to see if it is working, a <a href="/wiki/ccd.html" title="Charge Coupled Device">CCD</a> based camera, like a webcam will be able to detect it, it will show as bright white or red flashes from its origin.
