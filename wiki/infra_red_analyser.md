There are a number of devices capable of analysing [Infra Red](/wiki/infra_red.html "A type of EM radiation commonly used for digital communications") communications.

The most simple are an [Oscilloscope](/wiki/oscilloscope.html "Systems designed to view voltage/current over time") with a phototransistor - and a little circuitry, right up to complex protocol analysers, which can analyse the timing, the baud rate - and shift in the data to registers.

All [Infra Red](/wiki/infra_red.html "A type of EM radiation commonly used for digital communications") devices are digital [serial](/wiki/serial_data_stream.html "Serial Data Stream") devices, which simplifies things somewhat.

If you want some makeshift detection just to see if it is working, a [CCD](/wiki/ccd.html "Charge Coupled Device") based camera, like a webcam will be able to detect it, it will show as bright white or red flashes from its origin.
