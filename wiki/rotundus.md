<p>&lt;img src="show_image.php?id=168" align="right" /&gt;Rotundus is a real spherical <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/security_robots.html" title="Security Robots">Security Robot</a>. As it is basically a small sphere - it is able to negotiate many landscapes, including water, though not stairs. Beyond its obvious weakness - it is capable of sensing intruders and alerting others to their presence.
</p>
<p>At the moment it is only simply a prototype, and may not be available for a short while.
</p>
<p>It was actually designed for Planetary Exploration by the Ã…ngstrÃ¶m Space Technology Center - a faculty of Uppsala University, Sweden.
</p>
<p>It uses a pendulum based propulsion method - where the weight of the pendulum suspended in the direction it wants to go causes the robot to roll forward - thus by continuing to swing the weight out, it will continue forward. Think of a hamster ball. It turns by swinging the weight a little to the side - but it does maintain a clear distinction between its sides and its rolling surface. The sides have wide angle cameras fitted to report its findings. This method allows a maximum speed of around 32kph (20mph).
</p>
<p>The current version does not have enough power to deal with slopes very well - but expect later versions to do so. The spherical design means it is less likely to get stuck as some angular robots are prone to. However - like The Daleks<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: The Daleks">?</a> it has some trouble climbing stairs.
</p>
<p>From the pictures on the <a class="wiki" href="tiki-directory_redirect.php?siteId=124" rel="">infosheet</a> it appears to be around the size of a large bowling ball - and probably none too light. Given the way it can propel itself - this would make it very hard for an intruder to try and lift it, or interfere with it. It is also constructed in a way that presents no external moving parts, and to be very airtight. This makes it great for sand and water.
</p>
<p>It has been comercialised for the Security usage by the Swedish Rotundus company. The company have an animation showing the locomotion mechanism on their website - <a class="wiki" href="tiki-directory_redirect.php?siteId=125" rel="">Rotundus Animation</a>.
</p>
<p>In this incarnation it is able to chase would be intrudors, and is capable of rasising the alarm, using microphones to record them, getting snapshots of them while moving or even calling for backup. It has a slightly ominous likeness to the white sphere in "The Prisoner".
