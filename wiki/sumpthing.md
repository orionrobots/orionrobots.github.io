<p>Sumpthing is a monstrosity of a <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/robot_wars.html" title="The british robot smashing TV series.">Robot Wars</a> competitor which was built almost entirely out of scavenged automobile scrap.
</p>
<p>It has come from the darkest depths of <a  href="http://www.teamtetanus.com" rel="external" target="_blank">Team Tetanus</a> and The <a  href="http://uk.geocities.com/sumphq/TeKsNSpecs.html" rel="external" target="_blank">Lo-Tek Alliance</a>
</p>
<p>It threw out many ideas of complex and highly technical robots for a very simple, yet functional bot with great features and an uncanny robustness.
</p>
<p>One neat idea is the modular components system.  At Orion Robots, we like modular. Hence why <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> is so popular. It allows Team Tetanus and Mr Dig to quickly change a weapon system for one more suitable to their next opponent, or swap out a damaged part for another - saving time in the pit. The fact that this is also a <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/salvage_tips.html" title="Tips on pulling stuff apart to build robots. How, where and what.">Salvaged</a> robot only makes us like it more...
</p>
<p>They dont like boxes and enclosures much - which makes for a much more interesting robot, and with the correct design principle - the exposed innards are robust enough without them.
</p>
<p>It was built for less than £300, by Mr Dig(left), and Geoff Germaney.
