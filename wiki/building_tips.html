<p>The <a  href="http://shop.orionrobots.co.uk/products/orion-explorer-1-robot-kit" rel="external" target="_blank">Orion Explorer One Robot Building Kit</a> is a good way to start off a robot project - it means that you will have all you need for a moving robot.  The Controller, motors, wheels, chassis, battery box are taken care of. A construction guide shows you how to put these parts together. Based on the popular Arduino, there is a huge amount of example code and hardware to use it with, and code on github to get basic functionality on day 1. There is no soldering here, only a screwdriver, batteries and a connected PC with a free USB port are needed.

<br/>This is a tip picked up from <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/real_robots.html" title="Real Robots">Real Robots</a>.  When using self-tapping screws - perform a quarter turn back towards the end to loosen away swarf(excess material) before continuing to avoid stiffness.
</p>
<p>When using <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/pic.html" title="PIC">PIC</a>'s and other chips - always try to use sockets for these.  This means that when you have a fault, or wish to upgrade it, or reuse it - you can.  Also - it means that you have much less chance of damaging the chip when soldering the socket.  Many of these components are sensitive to heat.
</p>
<p>If you are working with IC's and transistors, always try to make sure you are earthed - buy a wrist band from your local PC dealer.  Many of these devices are sensitive to electrostatic discharges.  That also means you should store them in their protective bags.  I also tend to find a sheet of paper or card, during work, is a good place to store them temporarily. You can breifly earth yourself by touching a metal part of a case - but using the band means you have both hands, and ensures proper contact.
</p>
<p>Try to avoid using screwdrivers that are the wrong size for the screw- although it may be convenient and tempting to use one screwdriver for everything - you have a good chance of destroying the screw heads and screw driver.
