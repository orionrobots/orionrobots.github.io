<p>This is another signature cute robot product from <a href="/wiki/sony.html" title="Sony">Sony</a>.
</p>
<p>Its name is derived from "Quest for cuRIOsity" as they seek to replicate the curiosity found in a child, as well as the stature, and the idea that a smaller robot is more acceptable to humans - like <a href="/wiki/pino.html" title="The Pino Project aka Open Pino is intended as a standard platform for humanoid robotics.">Pino</a>.
</p>
<p>This android) is very much designed for human interactivity - and although expensive - is well on its way to a robot playmate rather like ((Isaac Asimov's Robby. It has a very smooth lifelike movement - and not the jerkiness normally associated with robots. Capable of basic conversation, facial recognition and its own navigation/information gathering - there is clearly some fairly interesting artificial intelligence behind it.
</p>
<p>But dont take our word for it - see it yourself at their site: <a href="http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/QRIO/" rel="external" target="_blank">http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/QRIO/</a>
