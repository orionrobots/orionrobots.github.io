<p>Computer Aided Manufacturing
</p>
<p>A sister concept to <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/cad.html" title="Computer Aided Design">CAD</a> this allows an engineer to plan and design the manufacture of an item designed in a CAD system.
</p>
<p>It may actually connect with robotic tools - such as welders, <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/agv.html" title="Automated Guided Vehical">AGVs</a>, drilling/milling machines and such to produce finished peices. It may translate to <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/cnc.html" title="CNC">CNC</a> for this.
