<p>Lego is a very popular material for building robots, not least because it is flexible, and modular. Although it is not the cheapest material - its versatility is renown.
</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> company have created a huge robot following with the <a href="/wiki/rcx.html" title="The Lego RCX">Lego RCX</a> as well as the CyberMaster. However - they already had a status - I have seen robot books from the 80's, instructing the reader to create a custom <a href="/wiki/parallel_data_stream.html" title="Parallel Data Stream">Parallel Port</a> robotics board, and interface it with <a href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> Motors and parts.
</p>
<p>It was the introduction of Technic Lego along with many working gears, motors, pneumatics which really did this for them. Although there are competing construction toys - <a href="/wiki/fischertechnik.html" title="FischerTechnik">Fischertechnik</a> and Mechano (known as Erector in the US) - no of them have quite the following or Kudos Lego has. They even have complex gears like differentials and clutches.

<p>I have built with Lego since the early days - at school we had a Dacta system that plugged into a BBC computer, and later the Technic Control Center. Although the <a href="/wiki/rcx.html" title="The Lego RCX">RCX</a> is a limited <a a="" brain="" for="" href="/wiki/microcontroller.html" robot="" title="A programmable digital controller (or ">MicroController</a> - it is very easy to use and really brought a lot of people into the robot building hobby.
</p>
<p>There are a number of Lego creations on the site - with photos, and <a href="/wiki/ldraw_system.html" title="The primary system for CAD representation of Lego parts">LDraw System</a> files. You can use <a href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> to build robot arms, pneumatic circuits, drive systems and more.
