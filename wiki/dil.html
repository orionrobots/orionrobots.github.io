<p>This is an acronym for "Dual In Line" chips/packages including <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/ic.html" title="Integrated Circuits">IC's</a>, connectors, and <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/resistor.html" title="Resistor">Resistor</a> Nets.
<br/>It literally means two sets of in-line pins. These packages normally have a notch indicating which end has pin one, and some have a small dot by pin 1.
</p>
<p>More complex systems like <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/cpu.html" title="Central Processing Unit">CPU's</a> now use Pin Grid Arrays as they need more density so they can get more connections into a smaller space - although with new fast in-circuit serial protocols, expect this to change and to see a reversion to low-pin-count packages again.
