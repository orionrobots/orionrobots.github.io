<p>Mecha is a term that could be used to generally describe any machinery, or robot, and is used in the general robot sense in the film AI<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: AI Movie">?</a>. However, it is more commonly used to describe walking machines, quite often battlesuits. These are normally manned, and generally bigger than a human, sometimes just slightly larger, and some as big as houses.
</p>
<p>They ma also be known as Mecks, mechs and meka.
</p>
<p>These are a common feature in <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/scifi.html" title="scifi">SciFi</a>, especially Japanese Anime and video games.
</p>
<p>Practically speaking, on normal land, they may not actually be very practical, as has been demonstrated so well in <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/robot_wars.html" title="The british robot smashing TV series.">Robot Wars</a>, legs are a nice easy target for a tank to ram or fire at. However, on very rough or uneven terrain, like rubble and rocky landscape, they may become a great deal more useful.
</p>
<p>Mecha may be two legged, or many legged, or may even have tank tracks instead. It is the fact that they have a generally human (or animal) appearance that may qualify them as mecha, although this is not a point that has been really hammered out.

<p>It is fascinating to think that many companies, individuals and groups are right now trying to create real mecha. A Japanese creator recently built a paintball firing Mecha, which although looking realistic, actually only shuffled with a ratchet mechanism, and didnt actually lift its feet to walk. If someone can find the link, please add it to the comments.

<p>Some plant machinery companies are investigating the use of six legged mecha for tree clearing robots, using hydraulic limbs.
