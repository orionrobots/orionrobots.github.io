Mecha is a term that could be used to generally describe any machinery, or robot, and is used in the general robot sense in the film AI. However, it is more commonly used to describe walking machines, quite often battlesuits. These are normally manned, and generally bigger than a human, sometimes just slightly larger, and some as big as houses.

They may also be known as Mecks, mechs and meka.

These are a common feature in [SciFi](/wiki/scifi.html "scifi"), especially Japanese Anime and video games.

Practically speaking, on normal land, they may not actually be very practical, as has been demonstrated so well in [Robot Wars](/wiki/robot_wars.html "The british robot smashing TV series."), legs are a nice easy target for a tank to ram or fire at. However, on very rough or uneven terrain, like rubble and rocky landscape, they may become a great deal more useful.

Mecha may be two legged, or many legged, or may even have tank tracks instead. It is the fact that they have a generally human (or animal) appearance that may qualify them as mecha, although this is not a point that has been really hammered out.

### Real Mecha Development

It is fascinating to think that many companies, individuals and groups are right now trying to create real mecha. A Japanese creator recently built a paintball firing Mecha, which although looking realistic, actually only shuffled with a ratchet mechanism, and didnt actually lift its feet to walk. If someone can find the link, please add it to the comments.

Some plant machinery companies are investigating the use of six legged mecha for tree clearing robots, using hydraulic limbs.
