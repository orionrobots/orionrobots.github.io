Its true.  <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> really do have a <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/solar_panel.html" title="Solar Panel">Solar Panel</a>.

I am not sure of the full specifications - only that it is part of their <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/dacta.html" title="DACTA">Dacta</a> range - the eLab sets specifically.

The Solar panel is part number <a href="http://www.peeron.com/inv/parts/32339" rel="external" target="_blank">32339</a>.  It is in green, and is available in the set <a href="http://www.peeron.com/inv/sets/9912-1" rel="external" target="_blank">9912-1</a>.

According to the Lego Site:

> The solar cell consists of seven (7) solar cells and a diode. They are connected in serial so the total volt = 7 x 0.4 V (a total of approximately 2.8 V).

<ul><li>  3 V, 200 mA at full sun outdoors
</li><li> 3 V, 100 mA at full sun indoors through window
</li><li> 2.5 V, 8 mA with light from 60 W incandescent lamp with 25 cm distance to solar cell (2000 lx)
</li><li> 2.5 V, 40 mA with light from 60 W incandescent lamp with 8 cm distance to solar cell (10,000 lx)
</li></ul>
<br/>Lego also offer the following cautions for its use:

<ul><li> The solar cell is not waterproof
</li><li> Do not bend excessively or push hard on the clear plastic window
</li><li> Do not step on or otherwise place heavy weight on the solar cell
</li><li> Ordinary incandescent lamps produce a lot of heat and should only be used for short periods and at a distance of at least 8 cm
</li></ul>
<br/>It can be purchased by individuals at <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/bricklink.html" title="Lego Trading Commnity">Bricklink</a> or Commotion Group.  Schools, Organisations and Colleges should contact their <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/dacta.html" title="DACTA">Dacta</a> distributor.

Although the standard Lego Motor (with 5225, RCX etc) runs at 9v, it can be run from these lower voltages.  Combine this set with the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego_capacitor.html" title="Lego Capacitor">Lego Capacitor</a> and a few other components - and you can build a Lego <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/beam_robots.html" title="Biology, Electronics, Aesthetics and Mechanics">BEAM Robots</a> example.
