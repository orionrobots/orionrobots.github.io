<p><a href="/wiki/leonardo_da_vinci.html" title="Leonardo Da Vinci">Leonardo Da Vinci</a> was known to have designed a <a href="/wiki/submarine.html" title="SubMarine">SubMarine</a>.
</p>
<p>This was around 1515, not long before his passing. As yet I have not found drawings online of these, only the later (1578) Bourne Submarine based upon principles from it.
</p>
<p>It was quite simply a shell, with space for one person to sit - and was designed as a "ship to sink other ships". It was actually only "Semi-Submersible".
