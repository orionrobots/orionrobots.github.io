A single acting cylinder is an actuator for a fluidic system like a [Pneumatic](/wiki/pneumatic.html "Use of air to operate and power actuators") or [Hydraulic](/wiki/hydraulic.html "Hydraulic") system.

It consists of a plunger which allows a pressurized fluid to get behind it. This will push out the piston, and has a spring on the other side of the plunger which will return it if the pressure is taken off.

Note that not all have any return mechanism, and this may have been down to having an opposing cylinder to go the other way, or merely to be pulled down by gravity. Some also used vacuum suction to return.

These are somewhat less controllable than a [Double Acting Cylinder](/wiki/double_acting_cylinder.html "A fluidic actuator with dual inlets allowing greater control"). They are perhaps less often used than they were. There was a time when these were the only type of cylinder available from [Lego](/wiki/lego.html "The best known construction toy") in their [pneumatic](/wiki/pneumatic.html "Use of air to operate and power actuators") range.
