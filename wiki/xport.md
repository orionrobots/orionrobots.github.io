<p>The <a  href="http://www.charmedlabs.com" rel="external" target="_blank">Charmed Labs</a> XPort 2 is a fantastic device.
</p>
<p>Combined with a Gameboy Advance, you are able to get a very powerful MicroController.  Since it uses an <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/fpga.html" title="Field Programmable Gate Array">FPGA</a>, and has flashrom for programming the ARM cpu, it gives you a very versatile system, and the IO ports are very configurable.
</p>
<p>It has 64 programable digital IO ports (Lots!), and can be bought with a fairly decent development kit.
</p>
<p>The XPort may be extended furthar with the Robot Controller board, which has 4 <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/pwm.html" title="Pulse Width Modulation">PWM</a> outputs -compatible with Lego motors. These are Closed Loop Motor<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: Closed Loop Motor">?</a> ports with Back EMF Sensing<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: Back EMF Sensing">?</a> - so they sense the motors rotation as well as powering them. The controller also has 8 digital<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: digital">?</a> and 8 analogue sensor inputs, and seperate voltage supplies. Because of this power supply, it requires none of that messing around with active sensor bridge circuits normally associated with custom sensors on the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/rcx.html" title="The Lego Robot Command Explorer">RCX</a>.
</p>
<p>In a cheeky twist - the Xport Robot Controller has been given the acronym XRC - clearly a take on the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego_rcx.html" title="The Lego RCX">Lego RCX</a>. It is not compatible with Lego active sensors out of the box, but with this much programmability and an <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/fpga.html" title="Field Programmable Gate Array">FPGA</a> an emulation layer could probably be fashioned. There are also many more advanced sensors that could be used with it instead, and having so many IO ports makes it easier to interface. If you are used to modding things to go on <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/rcx.html" title="The Lego Robot Command Explorer">RCX</a> sensor pads- you will be able to use the multiple sensor ports even more effectively.
</p>
<p>Of course the fact that having it connected to the GBA gives you sound and a colour display makes this a great idea.  It is not the cheapest solution - but the most interesting I have seen. It does not come with any bricks, so it does not bear direct comparison with the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/rcx.html" title="The Lego Robot Command Explorer">RCX</a> or the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/nxt.html" title="Legos NeXT generation robotics kit">NXT</a> but if you already have a large cache of <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> or have an <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/rcx.html" title="The Lego Robot Command Explorer">RCX</a> and want to go furthar, then it is probably worth a look. Of course, it is by no means limited only to <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a>.
</p>
<p>Charmed Labs also sell an <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/ir.html" title="Acronym for Infra Red">IR</a> sensor - the XIR Sensor<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: XIR Sensor">?</a>, a BlueTooth module for wireless communication (one of the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/rcx.html" title="The Lego Robot Command Explorer">RCX's</a> biggest drawbacks was the InfraRed, but the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/nxt.html" title="Legos NeXT generation robotics kit">NXT</a> now has BlueTooth as well), and <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/holonomic_wheels.html" title="Holonomic Wheels">Holonomic Wheels</a>.
