<p>These were a tight knit group of serious <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/mindstorms.html" title="A Robotic construction toy system from Lego">Mindstorms</a> experts and master builders, brought together in secret, and under an NDA (Non-Disclosure-Agreement) to influence and guide the design of the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/mindstorms.html" title="A Robotic construction toy system from Lego">Mindstorms</a> <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/nxt.html" title="Legos NeXT generation robotics kit">NXT</a> - the next generation programmable brick, a successor to the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/rcx.html" title="The Lego Robot Command Explorer">RCX</a>, and the kit to go with it.
