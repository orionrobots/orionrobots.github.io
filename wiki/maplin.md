<p>Maplin Electronics have taken the place in the UK of Tandy and Radio Shack.
</p>
<p>They sell consumer electronics, <a href="/wiki/robot_kits.html" title="Robot Kits">Robot Kits</a>, Computer parts and a large range of electronic components. Although their catalogue is not as extensive as RS or Farnell, a high street presence makes them very convenient.
</p>
<p>They have recently scaled back their electronic component range, but there is still enough there to supply the basics like resistors, capacitors, servos and a small range of IC's.
</p>
<p>You can order online at <a  href="http://maplin.co.uk" rel="external" target="_blank">http://maplin.co.uk</a>
