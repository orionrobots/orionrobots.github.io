<p>A <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/genetic.html" title="This word describes the system used by all known biological lifeforms to store sticky (permanent) or static data.">Genetic</a> Algorithm is a method of design using a code, and an evolution system (survival of the fittest- gene/individual/population).
</p>
<p>If you are interested in this area - I must highly recommend Richard Dawkins Selfish Gene.

<p>OrionRobots is conducting research into this area. I will put some of my more simple examples of code on the site in the future.

Boden</td> <td class="odd">This book has some excellent coverage of evolutionary biology, and explores many other artificial life areas as well - such ass cost based systems. This book could well allow someone to combine GA's and BEAM principles for some truly awesome behaviour from cheap, low power bots. I refer back to this regularly during my research.</td> </tr> </table>
