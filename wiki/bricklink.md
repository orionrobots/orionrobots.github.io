<p><a class="wiki" href="tiki-directory_redirect.php?siteId=64" rel="">Bricklink</a> is a site designed for trading <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> parts, instructions and sets. There are hundreds of stores, and you can search by part numbers or categories.
</p>
<p>All the transactions are in US Dollars, but you can easily find UK and European sellers to buy stuff from. It has a rating/feedback system not unlike Ebay although it is not as often used. Prices can vary wildly - but when you search - all prices and locations are listed with the item and store details.
</p>
<p>It is strongly advised that you use this with <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/peeron.html" title="Online database of Lego Sets and Parts">Peeron</a> to lookup the sets and parts you are after. When looking to buy <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> in bulk, or find obsolete sets like the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/cybermaster.html" title="CyberMaster">CyberMaster</a> kit, Bricklink might be a good port of call. Of course, shop around at eBay and the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lugnet.html" title="Lego Users Group Network">Lugnet</a> marketplace before making a purchase.
</p>
