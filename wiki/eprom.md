<p>These are an improvement on <a href="/wiki/prom.html" title="Programmable ROM">PROM</a>. They allow a developer to program them (sometimes referred to as "to Blow" or "to burn") with information for use with a MicroController or <a href="/wiki/fpga.html" title="Field Programmable Gate Array">FPGA</a> - and are then simply a <a href="/wiki/rom.html" title="Read Only Memory">ROM</a>.
</p>
<p>However, if you wish to reprogram them, then you can expose them to <a href="/wiki/uv.html" title="Ultra Violet Light">UV</a> to erase their contents. The chip packages usually have a small window, which can be covered with a label to protect them from accidental erasing.
