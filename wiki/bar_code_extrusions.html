<p>These could be used for a form of gun control (gun barrels and shells), reducing cycle/vehical theft and other items.

<p>Basically - when extruding metal for using these applications, use metals which bond well, but do not mix, and extrude two tones in a bar code as part of the section. This will mean it cannot be filed off - as it is an integral part of the structure of said item. It may simply be a case of applying a permanent tint/pigment to sections of the metal as it is extruded.

<br/>Bar code scanners are fairly easily adapted to this, and ubiquitous enough for police and forensics to have them. However, the machines to form it are non-trivial, so there is still great scope in thinking through methods to apply it.
