These are a great example of [Deferred Design](/wiki/deferred_design.html "Deferred design"). Chips based upon this technology actually consist of large arrays of [logic gate](/wiki/logic_gate.html "Devices designed to perform logical operations"), but which kind they behave as is determined by a program that is loaded as they start up. This means that by flashing the [firmware](/wiki/firmware.html "Software burned into a non volatile memory chip") of the device, these [logic gate](/wiki/logic_gate.html "Devices designed to perform logical operations") can be reconfigured to provide different behaviour.

While it may sound similar, it is vastly different from a simple [microcontroller](/wiki/microcontroller.html "A programmable digital controller (or "). In the case of a microcontroller, you program instructions to be run on a set of already hard-configured logic gates. You cannot do anything outside the function of the gates already present. But in the case of a PLD, the [logic gate](/wiki/logic_gate.html "Devices designed to perform logical operations") themselves are what may change, and indeed you could implement a microcontroller on a PLD.

A particular case of a Programmable Logic gate is the [FPGA](/wiki/fpga.html "Field Programmable Gate Array").
