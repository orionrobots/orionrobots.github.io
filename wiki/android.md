<p>An Android is defined as a robot which is built to represent a human or is human like.
</p>
<p>The term may cover very simple humanoid shaped robots, like C3P0 and even simpler, right up to replicants and simulants.

<p>The closest we are to this is probably the work of <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/rodney_brooks.html" title="Rodney Brooks">Dr Rodney Brooks</a>. <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/cog.html" title="A robotic model of human form and behaviour">Cog</a> represents a humanoid head and torso. Also the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/sony.html" title="Sony">Sony</a> <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/qrio.html" title="Qrio">QRio</a>, <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/honda.html" title="Honda">Honda</a> robots are functional androids.
</p>
<p>Make no mistake - we have started making great steps towards creating advanced androids, but we are still some way off recreating the work of Dr Soong (Data's builder).
