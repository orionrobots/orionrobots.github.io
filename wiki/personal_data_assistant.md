<p>Otherwise know as a PDA, these devices are small and handheld.
<br/>The two main competing brands(at time of writing) are <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/palm_computer.html" title="Palm Computer">Palm Computer</a> and PocketPC<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: PocketPC">?</a>.
</p>
<p>The basics of these are a CPU, <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lcd.html" title="Liquid Crystal Display">LCD</a> Touch Screen<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: Touch Screen">?</a>, wireless communication port( <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/ir.html" title="Acronym for Infra Red">IR</a>, <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/wifi.html" title="Wireless Lan">WiFi</a> or <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/bluetooth.html" title="Bluetooth">BlueTooth</a> ) and various expansion systems.
</p>
<p>They can be used for robot control systems but they are not cheap, and you will need additional electronics and software to interface them.
</p>
<p>In my experience, older <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/palm_computer.html" title="Palm Computer">Palm Computer</a>s are actually better for this than newer machines or PocketPC's. This is because they have a connector that can be wired as a <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/rs232.html" title="A serial communication standard">RS232</a>.
</p>
<p>Embedded Linux and ucLinux are efforts to port Linux onto these machines -which will make them a great deal more versatile for general computation and interfacing - although possibly less easy to use.

It includes specifications, beginner guides and is fairly easy to read. Also has enough information for an experienced builder not to find it a waste of time.</td> </tr> </table>
