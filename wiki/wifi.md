<p>This is a system used for short to medium range radio communications between local computer systems. It is actually an umbrella term, used for a number of ISO standards 802.11a,b and g.
</p>
<p>It has a fairly high rate of 11Mbps - which is faster than some wired <a href="/wiki/lan.html" title="Local area network">LAN</a> systems.
</p>
<p>The system can use security keys to ensure only desired machines can connect to the network, or it an be left open to allow anyone to connect.
</p>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/wireless.html" title="Wireless">wireless</a> network can be made of ad hoc devices which are all peers, or an Infrastructure system with access points and a central router.
</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/robotic.html" title="Robotic">robotics</a>, this can mean you could program a controller, or control a bot from a PC without the usual line of site in <a href="/wiki/ir.html" title="Acronym for Infra Red">IR</a> systems like the <a href="/wiki/rcx.html" title="The Lego RCX">Lego RCX</a> and the limitations of having a wired <a href="/wiki/serial_data_stream.html" title="Serial Data Stream">serial</a> or <a href="/wiki/parallel_port.html" title="Parallel Port">parallel</a> connector like the <a href="/wiki/oopic.html" title="OOPic">OOPic</a>.
</p>
<p>One nice thing about this, is once all the keys and connection is established, then TCP/IP is layered on top so normal network apps can sit on it fairly easily. This means your code can be tested on a wired communication system first, and keeps it quite simple.
