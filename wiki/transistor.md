<p>A Transistor is simply a block of <a href="/wiki/semiconductor.html" title="Semiconductor">Semiconductor</a> material which drove the silicon revolution. Each single transistor effectively an electronic switch. When you supply current to its base, a current is allowed to flow from the Collector to the Emitter.

<p>These pretty much replaced old <a href="/wiki/electronic_valves.html" title="Electronic Valves">Electronic Valves</a> - although for some audio applications <a href="/wiki/electronic_valves.html" title="Electronic Valves">Electronic Valves</a> are used because they give a unique sound - this is actually due to noise and imperfections - but it also made the sounds "richer".
</p>
<p>When these are combined in small numbers, you can build <a href="/wiki/boolean.html" title="Boolean">Boolean</a> gates - and then combining these more complex control systems. It is at the far end of these, with millions of transistors that you find the CPU's, <a a="" brain="" for="" href="/wiki/microcontroller.html" robot="" title="A programmable digital controller (or ">MicroController</a>s , graphic chips etc that go into the common robots and personal computers.
</p>
<p>Simple transistor circuits include The H-Bridge, <a href="/wiki/and.html" title="AND">AND</a> Gate, <a href="/wiki/or.html" title="OR">OR</a> Gate and the <a href="/wiki/not.html" title="NOT">NOT</a> Gate. They are also used for simple threshhold triggers in <a href="/wiki/beam_robots.html" title="Biology, Electronics, Aesthetics and Mechanics">BEAM Robots</a>.
</p>
<p>Transistors may also be used to amplify signals - if a lower voltage is used to control a much higher one, and with some transistors this can be done proportionally instead of "all-or-nothing".

<p>The most common type are bipolor transistors:
