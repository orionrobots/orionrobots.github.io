<p>If anyone has used an <a href="/wiki/infra_red_analyser.html" title="Infra Red Analyser">Infra Red Analyser</a>, we really need this information. It may be possible to use a digital video camera, as if the frame rate is quick enough you can sometimes see IR bursts on them.
</p>
<p>The first place to look is the Serial Port to Control Pad connection. It might be interesting to run the Cybot software in Wine, redirecting the port output to a fake port, then analysing this, while mirroring the stream to the real port - doing this for the return as well.  The chances are that the <a href="/wiki/infra_red.html" title="A type of EM radiation commonly used for digital communications">Infra Red</a> protocol used will just be an extension of this.
</p>
<p>We would need to check if it is Pulse Coded IR (used by Sony Remote controls), Space Coded REC-80 (used by Panasonic Remote controls), Shift Coded RC-5 (used by Phillips) or otherwise.
</p>
<p>I am still searching the net for it - but have not yet turned anything good up.
