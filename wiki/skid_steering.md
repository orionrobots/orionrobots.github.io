<p>Skid Steering, aka Differential Drive or simply tank style, is a system where each set of wheels, or tracks is independantly powered.
<br/>To drive forwards(or back), both left, and right set must be powered forward (or backward).
<br/>To steer left, the right side must be going faster than the left, and to be able to pull an on-the-spot spin, the left should be put into reverse. The opposite applies to make a right hand turn.
</p>
<p>The advantages of these is that you can turn on the spot, that you have can have a little more complicated wheel systems (like Tank Tracks, and <a href="/wiki/tri_star_wheels.html" title="An advanced form of traction">Tri Star Wheels</a>. They also lend themselves fairly well to robot control.
</p>
<p>The disadvantages are that to a human used to a steering wheel style system - they are a little non-intuitive. Also, motors are not often identical, even in the same batch, so you may get some drift you need to correct after travelling a little - that problem is solved an the <a href="/wiki/adder_subtractor_drive.html" title="Adder Subtractor Drive">Adder Subtractor Drive</a>.
