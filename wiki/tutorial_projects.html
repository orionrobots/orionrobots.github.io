<p>A good way to learn new skills in robot building and related subject is to use a tutorial, following it (or skipping it) until you have what you need to continue a project then modding away and making up your own.

<p>The <a  href="http://shop.orionrobots.co.uk/products/orion-explorer-1-robot-kit" rel="external" target="_blank">Orion Explorer Kit</a> has a construction guide which tutors a builder all the way up through building the robot, and running a first program on it. It is a simple way to get to the point of a moving robot, and is entirely designed to be modified.
