<p>This kit comes with a number of press out cardboard bits, a small two direction remote chassis and a small book.
</p>
<p>The remote chassis is the kind that turns when you reverse it - this is the only way to turn - so it is very limited, but would be fun for younger kids.
</p>
<p>It guides you through building a robot onto the remote chassis with double sided tape, as well as props and parts to build an obstacle course and a few challenges to steer the robot through.
</p>
<p>It is capitalising of course on the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/robot_wars.html" title="The british robot smashing TV series.">Robot Wars</a> idea. For a very young builder - it may inspire confidence, and give them a bit of quick satisfaction building. Although the cardboard is not really going to last all that long, and the tape does eventually loose its stickiness.
</p>
<p>Price wise - it is obviously cheaper than a <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego_rcx.html" title="The Lego RCX">Lego Mindstorms Kit</a> but it is a bit of a stopgap, and will leave someone looking for something a bit more challenging and versatile.
</p>
<p>It can be constructed in a single Sunday afternoon - and also contains a reward card/log book for scoring - encouraging a bit of competition with rank stripes stickers to go on the robot and two different cardboard covers for the remote unit.
</p>
<p>Pros:
</p>
<ul><li> Easy to get into
</li><li> Suitable for younger robot enthusiasts
</li><li> Cheaper than large robot kits
</li></ul><p>Cons:
</p>
<ul><li> Remote chassis is very limited.
</li><li> Sticky tape looses stickiness very quickly.
</li><li> While cheap - perhaps not that good value for money.
</li></ul><p>
