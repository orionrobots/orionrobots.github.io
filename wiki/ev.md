<p>Robots will only be enhanced by the gradual roll out of Electric vehicals, supplanting existing <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/internal_combustion_engine.html" title="As used in the common automobile">Internal Combustion Engine</a> and Hybrid Engine<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: Hybrid Engine">?</a> Cars. There have been many examples of them, but most have eneded up being silly looking concept cars, and relaly should have been made with exactly the same look and feel of a standard boring car, with only the difference in whats under the bonnet - until that point, we cannot expect a large uptake of them.
</p>
<p>Companies like <a class="wiki" href="http://goingreen.com" target="_blank">http://goingreen.com</a> and Honda have commercialised on it. The Toyata<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: Toyata">?</a> Prius is an interesting compromise on the concept as well.

<h2  id="What_does_this_mean_to_robots_and_builders_">What does this mean to robots (and builders)?</h2>
<ul><li> Better batteries - battery sizes, and costs will come down immensely when they are used in vehicals. Look at the progress created by the mobile phone and PDA market. The days of standard battery sizes being the only choice have gone. While AA is convenient in purchasing, it is large and inneficient compared to some other formats. For big robots, big EV batteries will greatly enhance them - and we are guaranteed to see a generation of battle bots and others based on them. <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/fuel_cell.html" title="Fuel Cell">Fuel Cell</a> technology is being pushed now, with a motorbike running on it, and even mobile phone companies jumping on board.
</li></ul><p>
</p>
<ul><li> Better Motors - EV's are based on electric DC motors. This means large DC motor technology may be enhanced as they are mass produced in the sizes and efficiencies needed for EV's. Expect to see these replace washing machine/wheelchair motors in robots. Did you know there was recently a car that could drive over huge ranges on a single AA battery?
</li></ul><p>
</p>
<ul><li> An old EV would have great Salvage potential - as they also will have some superb control and power management electronics.
