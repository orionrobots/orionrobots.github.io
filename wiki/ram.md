<p>This is used to refer to memory in a computer or <a a="" brain")="" for="" href="/wiki/microcontroller.html" robot"="" title="A programmable digital controller (or ">MicroController</a> than can be written to, and read from in a random manner. Early memories used to be sequential only- that is - you could only read them out in the order they were written - kind of like a tape. Most memory these days can be classified as RAM.
</p>
<p>Most RAM is volatile - that is, it will retain what is written to it, until the power is switched off - some kinds of memory - like <a href="/wiki/flash_memory.html" title="Flash Memory">Flash Memory</a> are non-volatile, and will retain there memory for a reasonable time after the power is switched off.
</p>
<p>Some RAM statically stores the data - when a circuit (a <a href="/wiki/bit.html" title="Binary Digit">bit</a>) is flipped to one state, it remains so until it is flipped the other way, or power is lost - this is called static RAM. A great deal more modern RAM is dynamic RAM, which is considerably cheaper - and the stored bits will gradually decay-  so they need special control circuitry to continuously refresh the Bits.

<p>The current other kinds of memory are <a href="/wiki/rom.html" title="Read Only Memory">ROM</a> and <a href="/wiki/flash_memory.html" title="Flash Memory">Flash Memory</a>.
