<p>Honda have a history of developing walking robots.
<br/>They started with their E0 - Experimental model 0 in 1986, and are now on the 11th generation - the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/asimo.html" title="Asimo">Asimo</a>.

<p>Their latest robots have a distinctly humanoid shape, and are being used for greeting - robotic receptionists and diplomats. I suspect we will see a lot more of them in the future.
