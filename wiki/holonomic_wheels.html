<p>These are wheels that have 2 <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/degrees_of_freedom.html" title="A term used for the axes of movement for a robot, or robot limb.">Degrees Of Freedom</a>, allowing them to move in more directions than forward and back.
</p>
<p>This allows for design of a based that can move in the X and Y directions without needing to turn, and also rotate while maintaining a straight line - giving the mobile base a full 3 degrees of freedom.
</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.charmedlabs.com" rel="external" target="_blank">Charmed Labs</a> actually produce a set of these that can be used with standard <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> axles.
</p>
<p>I am still researching into who actually developed them - I know there has been more than one attempt to patent them.
