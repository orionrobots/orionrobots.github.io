<p>One application forseen (And already indeed in use) for robots is security. Security can be a fairly high risk job, and with some less savoury or more determined characters- you may be putting yourself directly in the firing line.
</p>
<p>Now the thing is - you cannot expect security robots to be too clever, and at their safest - little more than mouthy equivalents of security dogs. While I am a robot labour advocate - I would not want robots touting guns. Although I am not really a great beleiver in things ending up like The Cylons or The Terminator - all it would take is a simple bug (not AI but simple programming mishap) for the gun to fire when not intended (I dont mean monster - I mean simply malfunction). Something like that would need extensive testing before being deployed - and also a method for a security control room (which would still be required) to be alerted before such events (ie a closed circuit that only allows a weapon deployment after such notification - and that allows override from the control room).
</p>
<p>Saying that - there are systems - like the <a href="/wiki/rotundus.html" title="Rotundus">Rotundus</a>. Some securioty robots are simply for surveillance - cameras on mobile platforms. If the camera is able to recognize an intruder, then it can alert the authorities and take a nice snapshot, or point the current security monitor feed at what they have caught. They can also - as said before - be very mouthy, and try to deter the intruder - inform them that the authorities have been called, that they are now being watched, that there movements have been recorded and are now stored at a secure location. The robot may even be able to try and discretely get some form of biometric identification so the intruder can be positively ID'd.
</p>
<p>One problem is of course the robot may be then attacked- but this is much better than a human being attacked, and besides- it the surveillance data has already gone off to a remote location. If the robot is however more expensive than the equipment being protected - then it is a matter of serious consideration.
