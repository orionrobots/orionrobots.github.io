<a class="wiki" href="tiki-directory_redirect.php?siteId=70" rel="">Hexbot.com</a> hosts a natural language <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/ai.html" title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</a> search engine, which professes to even communicate and assimilate data from other chatbots. It has a P2P network of <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/ai.html" title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</a> computers to spread the load, and apparnetly easily expand the system. The creators profess some very advanced <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/ai.html" title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</a> techniques - which probably warrant investigation.
