<p>James Jessiman was the much hailed creator of the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/ldraw_system.html" title="The primary system for CAD representation of Lego parts">LDraw System</a> <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/cad.html" title="Computer Aided Design">CAD</a> file format, and a number of parts in the library.
</p>
<p>He created the system just as an extension to his interest, and his website has kindly been preserved in its original state in memory to him. His legacy will mean that <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> users have been able to share, design and preserve their models in an electronic format - a true and major contribution to this community.
</p>
<p>He passed away sadly on July 25th, 1997. He will not be forgotten by a great many <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> users and contributors.
