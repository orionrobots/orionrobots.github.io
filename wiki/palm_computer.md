These are [Personal Data Assistant](/wiki/personal_data_assistant.html "Personal Data Assistant")s with a rather nice Operatign System and a slightly different way of thinking.

They are also commonly refered to as Palm Pilot's - the name of the original first model.

While linux says "Everything is a file", and windows makes it up as it goes along, to Palm OS - everything is a database, record or table.

There are program to interface their [Infra Red](/wiki/infra_red.html "A type of EM radiation commonly used for digital communications") ports with [Cybot](/wiki/cybot.html "Cybot") and the [Lego RCX](/wiki/rcx.html "The Lego RCX"). There are also programs to interface 3-series serial ports with other serial devices. Quite versatile - abd you can store all your phone numbers on them as well...

Some books worth considering:

This book is amazing. Take your old Palm(a IIIc perhaps) and turn it into a serious robot base.  Including software, electronics examples and other stuff - this is a wonderful book.
