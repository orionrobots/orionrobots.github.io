These are what have now evolved into our common Flash ROM. Used in most MicroController development, the [Lego RCX](/wiki/rcx.html "The Lego RCX"), with phones and PDAs it has become much cheaper than it was.

It allows you to erase, and rewrite portions of the [ROM](/wiki/rom.html "Read Only Memory") regularly, as if it were really a Non-Volatile [RAM](/wiki/ram.html "Random Access Memory"), although it is usually the case that a write is an expensive operation, and it is much faster to write to [RAM](/wiki/ram.html "Random Access Memory").

Hardware is now produced to be updated - that is, firmware can be patched.
