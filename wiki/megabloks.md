<p>MegaBloks are a great deal cheaper than <a href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a>, and have some slightly different ranges, having a license to produce kits based upon The Transformers as well as being a lot more creative with their parts.
</p>
<p>Sadly, MegaBloks parts are not as well manufactured as <a href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a>, and are really not suitable for any advanced modelling. Their tolerances are much lower, and when stacked, look rather like a badly built wall. Small models and detail may be fine though, but they do not really have a range equivalent to Technic, and are absolutely out of the question for engineering.
</p>
<p>If cheaper <a href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> is what you are looking for, you are strongly advised to check eBay or <a href="/wiki/bricklink.html" title="Lego Trading Commnity">Bricklink</a>.
</p>
<p>Rumours are circulating that the StarTrek license has gone to MegaBloks.
