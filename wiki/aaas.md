The American Association for the Advancement of Science

This group hail themselves as the worlds largest scientific body. They are a non-profit organisation created for scientists to conference, and collaborate in a large union in the US. They are a relatively old establishment - founded in 1848.

We agree very much with their policy to advance the literacy, science and technology of mankind throughout the world.

[Dr Rodney Brooks](/wiki/rodney_brooks.html) is a noteable member of this organisation.
