This group hail themselves as the worlds largest scientific body. They are a non-profit organisation created for scientists to conference, and collaborate in a large union in the US. They are a relatively old establishment - founded in 1848.

We agree very much with their policy to advance the literacy, science and technology of mankind throughout the world.

A notable fellow of this organisation is [Dr Rodney Brooks](/wiki/rodney_brooks.html).
