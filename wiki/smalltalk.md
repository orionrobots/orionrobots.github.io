<p>This is an <a href="/wiki/object_oriented.html" title="Object Oriented">Object Oriented</a> and Dynamically Typed computer Programming Language. It has been used for <a href="/wiki/ai.html" title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</a>, but is not common in robotics.
</p>
<p>It is actually heralded as one of the better attempts at a properly object oriented language, which compared favourably in syntax with C++ or Java, but did not go as low level as C++. It was always a little esoteric, and developed (and still has) what can only be described as a cult following. It never seems to have been taken seriously enough to be used for a business language.
</p>
<p>From the outset it included a full GUI mouse driven system, and a rich framework which actually implemented much of the kernel and <a href="/wiki/idetool.html" title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</a> environment in SmallTalk code. Any of this code could be rewritten, or overridden. This means it is fairly powerful and adaptable. It is also a little slow because of this though.
</p>
<p>Developers interested in Smalltalk may find the languages Ruby or <a href="/wiki/python.html" title="Python">Python</a> interesting.
</p>
<p>Modern implementations include Sqeak - which is available on Linux and other platforms.
