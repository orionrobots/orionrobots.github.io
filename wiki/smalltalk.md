This is an [Object Oriented](/wiki/object_oriented.html "Object Oriented") and Dynamically Typed computer Programming Language. It has been used for [AI](/wiki/ai.html "Artificial Intelligence"), but is not common in robotics.

Smalltalk is sometimes seen as one of the better attempts at a properly object oriented language, which compared favourably in syntax with C++ or Java, but did not go as low level as C++. It was always a little esoteric, and developed (and still has) what can only be described as a cult following. It never seems to have been taken seriously enough to be used for a business language.

From the outset it included a full GUI mouse driven system, and a rich framework which actually implemented much of the kernel and [IDE](/wiki/idetool.html "Integrated Development Environment") environment in SmallTalk code. Any of this code could be rewritten, or overridden. This means it is fairly powerful and adaptable. It is also a little slow because of this though.

Developers interested in Smalltalk may find the languages Ruby or [Python](/wiki/python.html "Python") interesting.

Modern implementations include Squeak - which is available on Linux and other platforms.
