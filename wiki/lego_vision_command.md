<p>Vision Command is an extension to the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/mindstorms.html" title="A Robotic construction toy system from Lego">MindStorms</a> range of robotic education kits.
</p>
<p>It includes a USB camera (logitech house in lego moulds) and some visual recognition programming software - which works in a similar way to the software that comes with the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego_rcx.html" title="The Lego RCX">Lego RCX</a>.
</p>
<p>Using this with the RCX may mean you can give visual processing abilities to robots, but the big trade-off is that you are now tethered with a USB umbilical to the computer.
</p>
<p>I am not sure if you would be able to use a wireless usb connector with this device - as they are normally designed for printers and other low throughput communications.
