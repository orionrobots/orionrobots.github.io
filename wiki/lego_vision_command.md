Vision Command was an extension to the [Lego](/wiki/lego.html "The best known construction toy") [MindStorms](/wiki/mindstorms.html "A Robotic construction toy system from Lego") range of robotic education kits.

It includes a USB camera (Logitech housed in lego moulds) and some visual recognition programming software - which works in a similar way to the software that comes with the [Lego RCX](/wiki/rcx.html "The Lego RCX").

Using this with the RCX meant you could give visual processing abilities to robots, but the significant trade-off is tethering the robot with a USB umbilical to the computer.
