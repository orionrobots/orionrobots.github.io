Vision Command was an extension to the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/mindstorms.html" title="A Robotic construction toy system from Lego">MindStorms</a> range of robotic education kits.

It includes a USB camera (Logitech house in lego moulds) and some visual recognition programming software - which works in a similar way to the software that comes with the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/rcx.html" title="The Lego RCX">Lego RCX</a>.

Using this with the RCX meant you could give visual processing abilities to robots, but the significant trade-off is tethering the robot with a USB umbilical to the computer.
