<p>Pocket PC's were a <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/personal_data_assistant.html" title="Personal Data Assistant">Personal Data Assistant</a> group which use Windows CE operating system. The rest of this information was written around 2005. In 2017 - the Raspberry Pi is a far better option, with a touchscreen add on if you want it.

Some models may be re-flashed with a Linux operating system, making them more usable in robotics applications.

They have a minimum of an LCD touch screen, <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/infra_red.html" title="A type of EM radiation commonly used for digital communications">Infra Red</a>, <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/wifi.html" title="Wireless Lan">WiFi</a> and/or  BlueTooth communication port and some kind of USB or <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/serial_data_stream.html" title="Serial Data Stream">Serial Data Stream</a> connector.

Their small size and low power consumption may make them interesting robot control devices, while the touch screen gives a good method of Human Computer Interaction with a robot.

Orion used to own the HP1910 colour device which at present cannot be flashed with another operating system. He now owns the Dell Axim x30, for which other OS's are being ported.

If you buy one, you should ensure it has SDIO or CF slot, and take note of BlueTooth or WiFi systems it may come with.  If you are going to use it for robot applications - then consider the weight and power consumption.

If you are going to attempt to use it for remote control of robots - check if it supports consumer IR (all-in-one remote control ability).
