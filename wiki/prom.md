This type of [ROM](/wiki/rom.html "Read Only Memory") allows a programmer to populate it once, and once only. It can be used when developing an item on a small scale - now normally only after most of the initial development has done and testing has started.

Before, these were used as the only means of developing with MicroControllers and [CPUs](/wiki/microprocessor.html "Central Processing Unit"), and would be programmed, then thrown away and replaced when bugs were ironed out. Luckily, they were upgraded to [EPROM](/wiki/eprom.html "Erasable Programmable Rom"), then [EEPROM](/wiki/eeprom.html "Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM") - which then evolved into the common Flash ROM we use in our cameras, mobile phones and [PDA's](/wiki/pda.html "Personal Data Assistant").
