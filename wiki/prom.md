<p>This type of <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/rom.html" title="Read Only Memory">ROM</a> allows a programmer to populate it once, and once only. It can be used when developing an item on a small scale - now normally only after most of the initial development has done and testing has started.
</p>
<p>Before, these were used as the only means of developing with MicroControllers and <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/cpu.html" title="Central Processing Unit">CPUs</a>, and would be programmed, then thrown away and replaced when bugs were ironed out. Luckily, they were upgraded to <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/eprom.html" title="Erasable Programmable Rom">EPROM</a>, then <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/eeprom.html" title="Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM">EEPROM</a> - which then evolved into the common Flash ROM<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: Flash ROM">?</a> we use in our cameras, mobile phones and <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/pda.html" title="Personal Data Assistant">PDA's</a>.
