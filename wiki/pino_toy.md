<p>It has a height of around 40cm. It is also known as the Pino-DX and has a website at <a href="http://www.pinodx.com" rel="external" target="_blank">http://www.pinodx.com</a> in Japanese. It is not as advanced as the <a href="/wiki/robosapien.html" title="RoboSapien">RoboSapien</a>, but is fairly enchanting.
</p>
<p>It is a fairly faithful representation of the commercial shell for the <a href="/wiki/pino.html" title="The Pino Project aka Open Pino is intended as a standard platform for humanoid robotics.">Pino Project</a>.
</p>
<p>Sensor wise it has multiple sensors including light sensors behind its visor, a microphone (and responds to music and clapping, and three touch sensors on its hands and head.
</p>
<p>It is one of the most noisy robots I know, and comes with a simple program which mimics learning in much the same way as the Tekno Robot Dog. It has (from my observations) around 6 <a href="/wiki/degrees_of_freedom.html" title="A term used for the axes of movement for a robot, or robot limb.">Degrees Of Freedom</a> - its Legs count as one, as it walks forward on one motor, and employs a ratchet mechanism in the feet for grip. It shuffles and makes no real attempt to lift its feet. Its arms appear to move seperately - allowing them to be lifted up, and stretches out. It can move left and right, as well as forward at the hip. Again - I think the forward/backward hip motion is linked to the same motion in the head. The head can also swing around. It is likely that it is simply be an intricate <a href="/wiki/cam.html" title="CAM">Cam</a> system - somewhat like the <a href="/wiki/furby.html" title="Furby">Furby</a>. The fact that he does not seem to be able to move the head, arms and waist at the same time probably shows evidence of this.
</p>
<p>Other built in behaviours include singing, dancing, playing sentry guard(until light or noise wakes him), sleep (very useful for such a noisy bot) and interact with other Pino Toys.
</p>
<p>At this stage I have not opened him up "to see what makes him tick".
</p>
<p>Anybody know why they chose to make the nose long and silly? Its transparency is because there is a sensor behind it.
</p>
<p>This robot is a neat and relatively cheap little toy, but for those really serious about owning Robotic Gadgets And Toys - they should consider <a href="/wiki/mark_tilden.html" title="Mark Tilden">Mark Tilden</a>s Robo Sapien.
