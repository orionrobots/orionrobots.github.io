Genghis is a very classy walker created by <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/rodney_brooks.html" title="Rodney Brooks">Rodney Brooks</a> of iRobot.

It has six legs, and uses Subsumption Architecture.

It has an array of heat sensors, and is built up with behavioural layers from a basic instruction top stand, through to walking(lifting a foot, and following with an involuntary step reflex), through to a complex hunt and prowl behaviour.

Genghis sensing behaviour is based on movement. When it senses movement, it will turn towards it, and walk towards the stimulus.
