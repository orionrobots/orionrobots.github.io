<p>These are a great example of <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/deferred_design.html" title="Deferred design">Deferred Design</a>. Chips based upon this technology actually consist of large arrays of <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/logic_gate.html" title="Devices designed to perform logical operations">logic gate</a>, but which kind they behave as is determined by a program that is loaded as they start up. This means that by flashing<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: flashing">?</a> the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/firmware.html" title="Software burned into a non volatile memory chip">firmware</a> of the device, these <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/logic_gate.html" title="Devices designed to perform logical operations">logic gate</a> can be reconfigured to provide different behaviour.

<p>While it may sound similar, it is vastly different from a simple <a a="" brain")="" class="wiki" for="" href="/wiki/microcontroller.html" robot"="" title="A programmable digital controller (or ">microcontroller</a>. In the case of a microcontroller, you program instructions to be run on a set of already hard-configured logic gates. You cannot do anything outside the function of the gates already present. But in the case of a PLD, the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/logic_gate.html" title="Devices designed to perform logical operations">logic gate</a> themselves are what may change, and indeed you could implement a microcontroller on a PLD.
