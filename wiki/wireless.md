<p>This is a common term used to mean radio transmission. Although there are no wires in <a href="/wiki/infra_red.html" title="A type of EM radiation commonly used for digital communications">Infra Red</a>, it is not what people generally mean when they say wireless.
</p>
<p>Good examples are <a href="/wiki/rc.html" title="Remote Control">RC</a> cars, <a href="/wiki/bluetooth.html" title="Bluetooth">Bluetooth</a> - a Wireless device communication stack, <a href="/wiki/wifi.html" title="Wireless Lan">WiFi</a> and <a href="/wiki/cybermaster.html" title="CyberMaster">CyberMaster</a> - A Wireless <a href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> <a href="/wiki/robotic.html" title="Robotic">Robotics</a> platform.
</p>
<p>Building a robot with wireless communications system may mean they are able to communicate and download new programs fairly easy.
<br/>In fact, early robots - like Shakey, were connected to huge computers via a radio link.
</p>
<p>These are however susceptable to interference- and without encoding - interception or corruption. While these would present great troubles to a home grown or raw protocol, <a href="/wiki/bluetooth.html" title="Bluetooth">Bluetooth</a> and <a href="/wiki/wifi.html" title="Wireless Lan">WiFi</a> deal with such problems fairly well.
</p>
<p>Beware - noisy motors without supressor <a href="/wiki/capacitor.html" title="Capacitor">caps</a> may seriously degrade signal quality (and therefore range and download speed) quite significantly. If you are intending to sell any robot - you must consider the various RF laws and recommendations. Many bandwidths are pre-allocated, so using the hobbyist 27mhz band is recommended.
