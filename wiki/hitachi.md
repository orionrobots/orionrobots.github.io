<p>Hitachi are probably best known for their consumer electronics arm, although they do have a strong presence in <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/robotic.html" title="Robotic">Robotics</a>.
</p>
<p>They are responsible for a number of <a a="" brain="" class="wiki" for="" href="/wiki/microcontroller.html" robot="" title="A programmable digital controller (or ">Microcontrollers</a> including the one powering the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego_rcx.html" title="The Lego RCX">Lego RCX</a>.
</p>
<p>They have now also surfaced as a builder of robots, as is highlighted in my <a href="http://orionrobots.co.uk/-- review bloglink --?blogId=1&amp;postId=10" rel="external" target="_blank">Blog Artical</a> on there recent contribution.
</p>
<p>Hitachi are in the running to join the ranks of <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/sony.html" title="Sony">Sony</a>, <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/honda.html" title="Honda">Honda</a> and Toyota in the race to get commercial success with serious robotics.
</p>
<p>There consumer electronics role is relevant, as they have also produced robotic vauum cleaners, not unlike the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/roomba.html" title="A Robotic vacuum cleaning system">Roomba</a> and are in competition with <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/dyson.html" title="Dyson">Dyson</a>.  Hitachi are also involved a lot with consumer washing machines, and modern ones have enough actuators, programming and sensors to qualify as real robots - even if they dont look like robots or gather as much attention as an <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/android.html" title="Android">Android</a>.
