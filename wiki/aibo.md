<p>This is the series of wonderful and imaginative cute robot dog devices created by the now defunct "Sony Dream Robotics" a division of the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/sony.html" title="Sony">Sony corporation</a>, which specialised in designing and building recreational robots.
</p>
<p>They have multiple motors, and sensors, including cameras, touch sensors, microphones, tilt sensors and all sorts of sophisticated arrays of gear. With the sheer amount of flexibility, it is a fairly interesting platform to work on.
</p>
<p>The AIBO uses a 64 Bit RISC<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: RISC">?</a> based <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/cpu.html" title="Central Processing Unit">CPUs</a>, and have their own operating system<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: operating system">?</a>, though it is likely that someone somewhere has ported or attempted to port Linux<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: Linux">?</a> to it.
</p>
<p>The users have formed a community of hackers and enthusiasts as is normally the case for any robot toy. It is hackable - but also very expensive. The Aibo allows some amount of programming and hacking - and there is a community based around such things. At first Sony resisted the hacker community, but it is believed they reached a point where they realised that they were a benefit - increasing the desirability and uses of the Aibo, and began to be more responsive. Advice for those not already owning an Aibo is to consider the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/robosapien.html" title="RoboSapien">Robosapien</a> first.
</p>
<p>There are a number of models, clearly some more hackable or programmable than others. The amount they are hackable allow them to cross from "expensive toy" to research platform. It is a good thing that the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/robosapien.html" title="RoboSapien">Robosapien</a> design took this into account.
</p>
<p>OrionRobots do not currently have an Aibo, but any donations would be welcome!
