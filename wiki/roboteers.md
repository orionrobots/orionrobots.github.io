<br/>A term commonly used in <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/robot_wars.html" title="The british robot smashing TV series.">Robot Wars</a> to describe robot building and competing teams.
</p>
<p>I am not sure if <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/craig_charles.html" title="Craig Charles">Craig Charles</a> or the commentator coined the phrase, or if indeed there is prior usage.
