<p>P-Brick is an acronym for a programmable brick. <a href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> do a number of these:
</p>
<ul><li> <a href="/wiki/spybotics.html" title="Lego Programmable robot kits">SpyBotics</a>
</li><li> <a href="/wiki/rcx.html" title="The Lego RCX">Lego RCX</a>
</li><li> Lego Scout
</li><li> <a href="/wiki/cybermaster.html" title="CyberMaster">CyberMaster</a>
</li></ul><p>
<br/>These are part of <a href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego's</a> <a href="/wiki/mindstorms.html" title="A Robotic construction toy system from Lego">Mindstorms</a> range. They allow a user to do robotics experiments through being able to program and interface these bricks. Most listed will work with <a href="/wiki/nqc.html" title="Not Quite C - A Lego PBrick Programming Language">NQC</a>.
</p>
<p>It is worth noting that many of the <a href="/wiki/construction_toy.html" title="Construction Toy">construction toys</a> are now producing these as well as <a href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a>. FischerTechnik have a very interesting system.
</p>
<p>The important aspects of a P-Brick are reusability, easy structural and electronic interfacing, a decent array of sensors and actuators in the system, and a progressive programming system - that is - a simple one to get kids started, and an advanced one like <a href="/wiki/nqc.html" title="Not Quite C - A Lego PBrick Programming Language">NQC</a> for more advanced tasks.
