<p>Python is a programming language which is great for testing and researching.
<br/>It is interpreted, and not compiled like C. This means it takes a speed hit. However it is written with such a simple and high level command set that it more than compensates. It allows 400 line C programs to be written in 3 lines - which may boil down to faster more efficient C code than the 400 line program anyway.
</p>
<p>Because of the way it deals with memory and allocation, it frees you from having to deal with too much of this yourself, or who a string or object belongs to. It does a certain amount of internal reference counting and therefore is fairly memory efficient.
</p>
<p>There are a large number of API's written for Python on the net, making it fairly simple to do most tasks with it - including full blown GUIs with wxpython, OpenGL renderers, databases and games.
</p>
<p>It is a very good choice for AI code because it encourages good readable code practices, and allows you to concentrate more on program behaviour than minute details.
