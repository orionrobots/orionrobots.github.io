<p>First appearing in the First heat of the Sixth Season of <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/robot_wars.html" title="The british robot smashing TV series.">Robot Wars</a>, this formiddable house robot packs a punch.
</p>
<p>He has a huge pounding hammer and a very menacing look - almost like a butcher. This is apt - he will grind down smaller bots quite effectively.
</p>
<p>He has twice the lifting force of Sir Killalot and is paired up with his companion Growler - both of whom were introduced with a elaborate ceremony.
