The Anode is the positive (+) connection to a polarised device like a [diode](/wiki/diode.html "Diode"), Electrolytic/Tantalum [Capacitor](/wiki/capacitor.html "Capacitor") or [LED](/wiki/led.html "Light Emitting Diode").

Generally - it is considered a very bad idea to connect a negative DC voltage to the anode of any device.
