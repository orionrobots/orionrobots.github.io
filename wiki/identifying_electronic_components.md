If you are building robots, and salvaging, you will need some background on what kind of [electronic](/wiki/electronics.html "Electronics") components you are going to use and or require.

- [Resistor](/wiki/resistor.html "Resistor")
- [Capacitor](/wiki/capacitor.html "Capacitor")
- [Transistor](/wiki/transistor.html "Transistor")
- [Diode](/wiki/diode.html "Diode")
- [Relays](/wiki/electronic_relay.html "An electrically activated switch")
- IC's

OrionRobots have a component identification key in development, and will be putting it here when it is ready.
