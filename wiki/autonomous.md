<p>A description of something, which once set in motion, needs little or no furthar intervention.
</p>
<p>In terms of robots, it means those with some intelligence and ability to respond to their surroundings.  A remote control vehical is not autonomous and is better described as a <a href="/wiki/rov.html" title="ROV">ROV</a>.
</p>
<p>Some say one of the biggest failing of <a href="/wiki/robot_wars.html" title="The british robot smashing TV series.">Robot Wars</a> is the fact that none of the robots have any degreee of autonomy, although the (good) argument to this is safety. An autonomous robot battle event would at the minimum require a remote to be sending a constant signal to allow power.
