<p>An impellor is more efficient at moving and pressurising fluid than a <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/propellor.html" title="Propellor">propellor</a>. It  consists of the same propellor blades, possible longer along its axis and with a smaller radius, enclosed in a fairly tight fitting enclosure.
</p>
<p>When used in a fluid, it needs to be totally surrounded by the fluid to function, and it creates a channel with a low pressure area behind it, thus forcing more fliued through the enclosure. This technique is just as useful in fans and air pumps as it is in water or liquids.
</p>
<p>On a boat or <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/submarine.html" title="SubMarine">Submarine</a> it gives greater thrust than a <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/propellor.html" title="Propellor">Propellor</a> as long as its intake and output are both completely submerged. Impellors were used to great effect like this in one fantastic <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/scrapheap_challenge.html" title="Quirky British Gameshow">Scrapheap Challenge</a> show.
