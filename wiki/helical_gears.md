<p>When designing geared mechanisms one very important factor is <a href="/wiki/torque.html" title="Torque">Torque</a>.
</p>
<p>There is a point with normal gear when under high torque conditions - teeth will slip and grind - first reducing efficiency, and also damaging the system.
</p>
<p>Another thing is that you will occasionally get play or slack between the gears - this may reduce efficiency, as well as accuracy when using things like Servos or Stepper motors.
</p>
<p>One way to vercome these problems is to make the teeth of the gear <a href="/wiki/helical.html" title="Helical">Helical</a>. This can be done as simply as slightly slanting teeth - right the way up to a full worm gear- which have very little play, allow only a one way transmission, and can deal with very high torques.
</p>
<p>Effectively you are increasing the contact between the gears by using helical gears. This may lead to increased friction though - so you need to ensure these are well greased (but you were doing that anyway werent you?).
</p>
<p>Most professional transmission systems use these.
