When designing geared mechanisms one very important factor is [Torque](/wiki/torque.html "Torque").

There is a point with normal gear when under high torque conditions - teeth will slip and grind - first reducing efficiency, and also damaging the system.

Another thing is that you will occasionally get play or slack between the gears - this may reduce efficiency, as well as accuracy when using things like Servos or Stepper motors.

One way to overcome these problems is to make the teeth of the gear [Helical](/wiki/helical.html "Helical"). This can be done as simply as slightly slanting teeth - right the way up to a full worm gear- which have very little play, allow only a one way transmission, and can deal with very high torques.

Effectively you are increasing the contact between the gears by using helical gears. This may lead to increased friction though - so you need to ensure these are well greased (but you were doing that anyway weren't you?).

Most professional transmission systems use these.
