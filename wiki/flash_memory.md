<p>Flash Memory, or Flash <a href="/wiki/ram.html" title="Random Access Memory">RAM</a> is actually a form of <a href="/wiki/rom.html" title="Read Only Memory">ROM</a>.
</p>
<p>It is a non-volatile memory, that will store data until the data is changed, and will retain its data without power. It is slower than DRAM - Dynamic <a href="/wiki/ram.html" title="Random Access Memory">RAM</a>, or true <a href="/wiki/rom.html" title="Read Only Memory">ROM</a>, and the process of writting to it is more complicated.
</p>
<p>Flash <a href="/wiki/ram.html" title="Random Access Memory">RAM</a> used to be pretty expensive, but now it is being used in a multitude of Cameras, Phones, PDA's, and many of the <a href="/wiki/firmware.html" title="Software burned into a non volatile memory chip">firmware</a> chips in your PC - the prices have fallen dramatically compared with around 5 to 10 years ago.
</p>
<p>Flash Cards are becoming prevalent, and look set to replace the Floppy Disk once and for all.
