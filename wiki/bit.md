<p>A bit is a single peice of digital information in <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/boolean.html" title="Boolean">Boolean</a> logic. It may be either On or Off (True or False/1 or 0).
</p>
<p>It is by combining many of these simple units of information, that the information you see on your computer screen is stored, processed - and possibly presented (if you use a DVI digital to digital system). There power is that it is incredibly simple to manipulate these with fairly crude circuitry.
</p>
<p>Since you only need to detect on or off, this crude circuitry can be heavily minimised - and this is what we see in the millions of transistors seen in our processors, and meory chips today. The alternatiev is stored analogue, or multiple state data - which would mean the complexity of distinguishing many more states, and require more expensive, and harder to build or program hardware.
