<h1  id="Definition_of_terms">Definition of terms</h1>
<p>
</p>
<ul><li> Owner - shall refer to OrionRobots, specifically Orion and the Team who maintain the site
</li><li> Reader - Any person viewing the site, and reading material with the exception of barred parties.
</li><li> Contributor - Any person leaving comments, modifying the wiki or submitting articles with the exception of barred parties.
</li><li> User - A registered user
</li><li> Moderator - anyone with privileges allowing them to publish and edit content(outside of the wiki or their own content)
</li></ul><p>
</p>
<h1  id="Site_Charter">Site Charter</h1>
<p>This site is intended for the discussion of, and sharing of robot related material.  Other material may be briefly discussed, to the discretion of The Owner and Moderators.
<br/>This site is aimed at a wide audience - therefore submission of inappropriate content may result in removal at least, possibly a banning.  This includes comments and wiki entries.
</p>
<h1  id="Disallowed_Material">Disallowed Material</h1>
<p>Disallowed material includes(but is not limited to):
</p>
<ul><li> Inappropriate language
</li><li> Material of a nature (graphic or otherwise) not suitable for a minor.
</li><li> Hate material
</li><li> Any activities which may amount to grooming or in some way petting a minor
</li><li> Fly-posting/Fly-Blogging
</li></ul><p>
<br/>Some of the above may result in notification of relevant authorities
</p>
<p>Note that as a general rule all material should be on the topics of robotics and technology, items outside of this realm are likely to be off topic and considered spam.
</p>
<h1  id="Moderation">Moderation</h1>
<p>In the interest of keeping a harmonious community - moderators will not interfere with comment and discussion submissions by contributors unless the content is harmful or abusive.  OrionRobots is not a place for flamewars, please feel free to take them to IRC or <a  href="http://slashdot.org" rel="external" target="_blank">Slashdot</a>. We will from time to time also remove/blank out or obfuscate email addresses for the sake of the poster, but make no commitment to always do so.
</p>
<p>Comments that are left anywhere on the site, except through the personal messaging and contact system are public, and we reserve the right to publish, print, or remove any comment left here. If you do not agree to your comment being shown in the public domain, please do not leave them.
</p>
<h1  id="Banned_Groups">Banned Groups</h1>
<p>Members and operators of computers in domains owned by or acting on behalf of the RIAA, MPAA, SCO, Spammers, Virus creators or any other terrorist or fundamental religeous group, any spam organisation or such undesirables are not permitted to enter or read the site - and therefore the owners/moderators will take what ever actions are reasonable to keep them from entering or interacting with the site.
</p>
<h1  id="Contacting">Contacting</h1>
<p>Any reader wishing to contact the maintainers/moderators may do so using the following address orion AT OrionRobots dot Co dot UK, or via the <a class="wiki" href="tiki-contact.php" rel="">Contact Us</a> button in the menu.
</p>
<h1  id="Spam">Spam</h1>
<p>Spammers will find they are blocked, and will be reported to appropriate authorities if they get through our defences.  I will remind spammers again that it is now illegal to spam in the UK, and the CAN-SPAM act of the US equally regulates such unsavoury activities. OrionRobots has not, and will not send any spam or unsolicited mail. If you receive any mail that appears to be from us, please carefully check the headers as the message has most likely been forged. You may use the above contact details to pass it on to us where we may pursue the matter further.
</p>
<h1  id="Email_Users">Email Users</h1>
<p>Users who have been granted email accounts hosted by orion are reminded to use them responsibly and within the law.  The server will reject overly large emails(we do support SFTP for these users) and also any attempt to send mail to more than 10 recipients.
</p>
<p>Although we will take measures internally to prevent such occurrences, the content of any email sent to or from this server is the responsibility of the sender.
</p>
<h1  id="Disallowed_Email">Disallowed Email</h1>
<p>We may take action against any user who sends abusive, defamatory or offensive email. With some discretion this includes(but is not limited to):
</p>
<ul><li>Sexually Explicit Mail
</li><li>Hate or racially motivated mail
</li></ul><p>
</p>
<h1  id="Personal_Information_and_privacy">Personal Information and privacy</h1>
<p>
<br/>Email addresses are used only for account verification, and for requested update notifications.
</p>
<p>We will not ask for or disclose any other personal information from any reader or user.
</p>
<p>Readers are reminded to act with discretion when leaving their email addresses or other personal information in publicly readable comments and such. We will from time to time conduct small surveys which readers may participate in, though we are not interested in any personally identifiable information.
</p>
<p>Personal information left in forums/comments/postings which we consider undesirable (such as bare email addresses, dates of birth, personal home addresses) will be removed or blanked to prevent this becoming tempting for spammers or their information being used in an undesirable way.
</p>
<p>Orionrobots.co.uk is a participant in the Amazon Europe S.Ã  r.l. Associates Programme, an affiliate advertising programme designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.co.uk. We also participate in Google ad bars and Google search providing both ad revenue and a search box.
</p>
<p>The advertising should be relevant to the article being read - if a user finds adverts on the site that are completely inappropriate, please contact us and we will investigate - we have already taken steps to ensure certain ad campaigns on Google Ads will never be shown here.
</p>
<h1  id="Cookie_Policy">Cookie Policy</h1>
<p>
<br/>Like most websites, Orionrobots uses cookies to store login information so you do not need to re-enter your details as you navigate or return to the site.
</p>
<p>The Google Ad and search services we use may also use both Google and Doubleclick cookies to provide relevant advertising and ensure that we are correctly paid for them.
</p>
<p>Google analytics is used from time to time to identify trends so Orionrobots can best optimize the content to visitors - for example we have used to target translations to audiences from non-English speaking regions, and we have also used this to look at loading times to ensure users have a good experience.
</p>
<ul><li> Cookies are used to serve ads on this site.
</li><li> The cookies are used to serve ads to users based on their visit to this sites and other sites on the Internet.

</p>
<h1  id="Summary">Summary</h1>
<p>Above all, please enjoy the site and strive to create/maintain a co-operative and friendly community of robot-builders.  If <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lugnet.html" title="Lego Users Group Network">Lugnet</a> can be the friendliest site on the net, we can at least aim for second!
