<p>BrickOS is a small <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/os.html" title="An Operating System">OS</a> for the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/rcx.html" title="The Lego RCX">Lego RCX</a>. It is an <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/open_source.html" title="Products and packages which are generally free.">Open Source</a> project and allows fairly advanced programming of the brick with a full C and C++ programming environment using the gcc/g++ toolchain.
</p>
<h3  id="How_advanced_">How advanced?</h3>
<p>Normally RCX code is actually interpreted with a firmware system into code to run on the Hitachi HC-8 microcontroller - see <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/rcx_specifications.html" title="RCX Specifications">RCX Specifications</a>. This however can be slow, and even <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/nqc.html" title="Not Quite C - A Lego PBrick Programming Language">NQC</a> relies on this. There is an accelerated firmware from Dick Swan to help this - but it is still not as fast as running real native code.
</p>
<p>BrickOS actually allows you to compile binaries to run on the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/rcx.html" title="The Lego RCX">Lego RCX</a> so you get a level of speed and control not available from the other systems.
</p>
<p>This may come at the cost of increased complexity, but if you are already a seasoned C/C++ coder, you may find this more comfortable than trying to learn one of the other syntaxes or programming systems for the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/rcx.html" title="The Lego Robot Command Explorer">RCX</a>.
</p>
<p>If you are a Java person, you should probably consider <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lejos.html" title="A Java Based Lego RCX OS">LeJOS</a> instead.
