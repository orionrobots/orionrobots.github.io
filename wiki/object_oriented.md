<p>A programming technique often mis-spelled as "Object Orientated" programming.
</p>
<p>It is when you consider things as "Objects" and pass around objects - so most things have less dependancy and one idea or one class of ideas is treatly seperately.  It allows you to specify a class with data(or attributes), and methods to manipulate the class or the data.  A class may purely be data, or it may reference an interface to a hardware device.
</p>
<p>Because there is some amount of access control - some things may be hidden.  This can be very useful if you want to create something as a library - so when its internals change - the interfaces to it can remain the same, without breaking anything.
</p>
<p>One thing I particularly like about the concept is that it allows for modular programming.  Modular techniques are preferred because it promotes re-use, and means you do not have to re-invent the wheel.  <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> is a great example of a modular system.
