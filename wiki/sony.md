<p>Sony have a department specialising in creating robots such as the <a href="/wiki/aibo.html" title="The SONY Robot Dog">Aibo</a> and the <a href="/wiki/qrio.html" title="Qrio">Qrio</a>.
<br/>This department is known as Sony Dream Robotics.
</p>
<p>Sony keep their internal strategy on such things fairly quiet, and they are also not paricularly good at encouraging the robot hacker/modder community, although they are warming up and improving.
</p>
<p>Their platforms are clearly some of the most sophisticated in commercial mass production, and have the largest ranges of sensors and <a href="/wiki/degrees_of_freedom.html" title="A term used for the axes of movement for a robot, or robot limb.">degrees of freedom</a>. However - their robots are also some of the most expensive.
