<p><a class="wiki" href="tiki-directory_redirect.php?siteId=24" rel="">Peeron</a> allow <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> users to catalogue all their sets and parts in an online database. You can type in a set number , and you can retrieve a parts list, images, <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lugnet.html" title="Lego Users Group Network">Lugnet</a> links, availability and pricing at various outlets.
</p>
<p>It also allows you to build a personalised list of sets and parts you posses. This is a good way to manage your <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> inventory, so when planning a build, you can consider what you may need to buy to finish it. It is not unusual for advanced builds to involve buying parts in bulk from <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/bricklink.html" title="Lego Trading Commnity">bricklink</a> or eBay. It is handy to use peeron also when trying to find out the correct set number, or the actual contents of a set when buying something so you know what you will get for your money.
</p>
<p>The contents are somewhat community maintained, so generally tend to quickly have recently released sets as well as some of the earlier ones.
</p>
<p>It is also useful when working with any of the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/ldraw_system.html" title="The primary system for CAD representation of Lego parts">LDraw System</a> or other <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/cad.html" title="Computer Aided Design">CAD</a> systems to be able to work out the part number, although these part numebrs may not always necessarily match for those parts which have had numbers created for them.
