<div style=" float: right;"> <img class="img-responsive" src="image17"/> </div>Bleex is an <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/exoskeleton.html" title="A device/vehical worn to enhance human abilities">Exoskeleton</a> suit being developed at the Berkeley Robotics Lab and funded by <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/darpa.html" title="Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency">DARPA</a>. This project began in 2000.
<p>
<br/>The acronym is for the Berkeley Lower Extremity Exoskeleton. It is worn over the legs only, and takes the weight of a large backpack. It is intended for military personnel to be able to carry much greater loads safely, enabling infantry with larger weapons and other additional payloads to travel great distances.
</p>
<p>The system does not use any kind of keypad or joystick, but merely responds to the users intended movements as they move their own legs.
</p>
<p>This technology was demonstrated at the DARPATech Symposium in March 2004.
