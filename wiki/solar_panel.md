<p>Solar Power is a broad term describing the harnessing of the suns energy to provide energy for our own purposes. A solar cell normally refers to a single unit generating DC electricity from this. Each cell is capable of producing voltage from the suns energy (or strong light sources).

<p>Solar Panels are electric components which consist of one or more Solar Cells.

<p>Many smaller robots - for example <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/beam_robots.html" title="Biology, Electronics, Aesthetics and Mechanics">BEAM Robots</a> use this as their only power source, with a <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/capacitor.html" title="Capacitor">capacitor</a> to store a small residual charge if the sun is obscured. It is one of the freindliest <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/power_sources.html" title="Power Sources">Power Sources</a>, although current solar cell technology has not been researched as much as it could, and thety are fairly inefficient, taking a lot of power and unpleasant chemicals to produce. I have faith that these problems will be resolved.
</p>
<p>It is often an interesting study to build a solar powered robot with the ability to move itself towards better sources of light - what is known as a Photovore<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: Photovore">?</a>. We have built a few of these in the workshops and will be holding competitions for efficient solar power based robots.
