<p>Firestorm was one the strongest early robots in <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/robot_wars.html" title="The british robot smashing TV series.">Robot Wars</a>, and with Firestorm 2, it had established a strong legacy. Although flipper type robots bore me mostly now, this one was one of the greatest early robots - and will always be met with respect and admiration.
