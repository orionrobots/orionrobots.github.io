<p>Sometimes a system admin with a server without a UPS, or needing to change a UPS must be able to safely do so without turning off a machine, or causing risk to himself. What I am Proposing here is a system of maintaining power to a unit, while unplugging it.
</p>
<p>It consists of a thin wedge device - which is clasped over the plug, easing it slightly off the socket, and engaging the two or three pins (I envisage this in all known mains plug formats). There is a risk if the wedge is too thin - it may not handle the current needed - versus the risk of it being too thick, and disengaging the plug terminals from the mains socket before engaging them to provide power. The device itself of course has a normal mains plug on the other end. The user should then be able to re-attach the plug to another socket using the device - all the while providing power to the plug.
</p>
<p>It must be safe in a way - using a low voltage sensor circuit to see when it has actually engaged the plug, then enabling voltage to flow through it - touching it with finger should not mean electrocution.
</p>
<p>It should have a handle and simple operation.
</p>
<p>I think once I have built a prototype, no IT department will want to be without one. Please feel free to build your own - but if you are going to sell them, please negotiate royalties with me: <a class="wiki" href="tiki-contact.php" rel="">Contact Us</a>.
