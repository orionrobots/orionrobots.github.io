<p>A solenoid is an ElectroMagnet with a moving core.  When the magnet is energised, the movement of the coil is used for work.
</p>
<p>This could be used for example for electrically operated bolts - which slide out when the magnet is energised.
</p>
<p>Often this is also used a shorthand term to refer to a Solenoid Valve - a <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/pneumatic.html" title="Use of air to operate and power actuators">pneumatic</a> or <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/hydraulic.html" title="Hydraulic">hydraulic</a> valve which utilises the cores motion to actuate.
</p>
<p>Solenoid valves are extremely useful, and at the moment fairly hard to get hold of on the scale I need. A basic one of these would be a very welcome addition to the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> range.
</p>
<p><a  href="http://www.Fischertechnik.co.uk" rel="external" target="_blank">Fischertechnik</a> do a small solenoid 3/2 in their 34948 Pneumatic Robots Kit which is around £89.00.
<br/>It is also available as a spare 35327 £9.80.
<br/>It is about 15 x 20 mm with push on fittings
<br/>They charge £2.00 P&amp;P for spares and £5 for kits.
</p>
<p>An alternative is <a  href="http://www.techno-stuff.com/AirSol.htm" rel="external" target="_blank">Techno Stuff</a> who do a brick compatible with a solenoid - but it looks less of a neat solution than the FischerTechnik. At about £25 ($44) the AirSol is more expensive as well.
