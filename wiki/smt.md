Surface mounted Bank of Flip Flops</div>SMT or SMD (Surface mount devices) are the system that is predominantly and increasingly used in <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/electronics.html" title="Electronics">electronics</a> to mount components onto boards. It gives advantages for component size and density, material cost, cutting stray signal interference as well as crucially simplifying automation.
<p>
<br/>Surface mount components are not pushed through a board and <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/soldering.html" title="The standard method of attaching connecting wires and components to a board">soldered</a> the other side, but are both mounted and soldered on the same side. They are somewhat more difficult for a hobbyist to get into using but not completely impossible.
</p>
<p>Since components are beginning to only be produced using this method, it is a skill worth learning for a hobbyist building robot electronics, and it can be done by hand using a soldering iron.
</p>
<p>To do so with a soldering iron will require practice, patience, a set of tweezers, some sort of magnification and a steady hand.
</p>
<p>For a hobbyist, most of the time through hole components are recommended with either wire wrapping or <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/breadboard.html" title="breadboard">breadboard</a> techniques for simpler prototyping and modification.
