<p>Animatronic devices are props made for special effects, using electronics and motors to animate them and bring them to life.
</p>
<p>They tend to consist of miniature servos and other small motors, and a control console for the puppeteers. Their use in films and TV has been extensive, including the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park as well as just about any recent film with a Jim Henson creation.
</p>
<p>There are also kits now with animatronic heads available from many robot hobbyist shops, and it has become a common strand in robotics.
