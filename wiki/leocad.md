<p>LeoCad is an <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/open_source.html" title="Products and packages which are generally free.">Open Source</a> <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/cad.html" title="Computer Aided Design">CAD</a> system created by <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/leonardo_zide.html" title="Leonardo Zide">Leonardo Zide</a> and hosted at <a  href="http://www.leocad.org" rel="external" target="_blank">www.leocad.org</a>.
</p>
<p>It uses its own optimized piece library and works with a variety of <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> CAD formats based around <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/ldraw_system.html" title="The primary system for CAD representation of Lego parts">LDraw System</a> as well as its own format. It is actually the system of choice over the alternative <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/mlcad.html" title="MLCad">MLCad</a> for most builders, although at present it cannot be used to construct parts from primitives.
</p>
<p>Being the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/open_source.html" title="Products and packages which are generally free.">Open Source</a> choice, it may however, evolve at a much greater rate than <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/mlcad.html" title="MLCad">MLCad</a> could, and be the more extensible of the two.
</p>
<p>It runs happily on both Linux, and Windows, and simple installers (binaries) can be downloaded, or it can be built from source.
</p>
<p>It uses <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/opengl.html" title="The Open Graphics Library">OpenGL</a> and requires the GTK+ libraries on Linux.
</p>
<p>With Windows, there is a shell extension (plug in for the Windows file explorer) which allows you to get information on drawings from a right-click context menu.
</p>
<p>There is a relatively active community, and a couple of <a  href="http://www.leocad.org/lists.htm" rel="external" target="_blank">mailing lists</a> where you can keep on top of its progress.
