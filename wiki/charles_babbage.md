<p>Charles Babbage(1791-1871) was an early 18th-19th century mathematician and engineer.
</p>
<p>He is well known for his Difference Engine - the first successful automatic calculator and remains one of the finest examples of precision engineering of the time.
</p>
<p>His later Analytical Engine was a much faster and more powerful machine - a replica of which resides in the London Science Museum.
</p>
<p>It is often said that it is Babbages machines, and <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/the_lady_ada.html" title="History of The Countess Of Lovelace, and relationship to Computers and Robotics">The Lady Adas</a> programming that enabled us to get where we are with modern computing and robotics, with the help of (alan turing)) on the way. Indeed there are some very interesting Sci-Fi<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: Robot Sci Fi">?</a> stories based on the premise of robots or huge war-engines built using a Babbage style analytical engine.
</p>
<p>Babbages Analytical Engine was basically a steam powered computer - capable of storing 1 thousand 50 digit numbers in its memory.  He started work on this in 1834
</p>
<p>It was capable of carrying out very complex operations, and eventually the project was sadly abandoned.
</p>
<p>It was <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/the_lady_ada.html" title="History of The Countess Of Lovelace, and relationship to Computers and Robotics">The Lady Ada</a> who first used punched cards to create programs for the machine.
</p>
<p>He was Born in London on December 26, 1791.  He was the Son of a London Banker, Benjamin Babbage.
