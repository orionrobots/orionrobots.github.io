<p>At the moment, most Tennis Robots are of the type which catch balls, or fire balls at a training player to test and train them.

<p>Indeed table tennis seems to be the more popular choice, and it is also the most popular sport in South East Asia. In fact to Chinese and Japanese - it is their national sport
