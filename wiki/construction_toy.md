These are toys aimed at children yet have great value in creating
robots. In fact - building real robots with these toys has become a
great educational aid for teaching physics, electronics and many other
subjects.

[Lego](/wiki/lego.html "The best known construction toy") -
[MindStorms](/wiki/mindstorms.html "A Robotic construction toy system from Lego")
[Lego RCX](/wiki/rcx.html "The Lego RCX")  
Capsella  
Mechano  
[MegaBloks](/wiki/megabloks.html "A Cheaper alternative to Lego")  
K Nex  
FischerTechnik

Some people can get a little evangelical about only using a single
construction toy and not using any custom parts - but for the sake of
building robots - it may be better to swap and choose.

We have also recently come across an interesting idea allow the
interconnection of K Nex and
[Lego](/wiki/lego.html "The best known construction toy") called
[Sploids](http://www.sploids.com/).
