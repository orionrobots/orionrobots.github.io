<p>These are toys aimed at children yet have great value in creating robots.  In fact - building real robots with these toys has become a great educational aid for teaching physics, electronics and many other subjects.

<p>Some people can get a little evangelical about only using a single construction toy and not using any custom parts - but for the sake of building robots - it may be better to swap and choose.
</p>
<p>We have also recently come across an interesting idea allow the interconnection of K Nex<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: K Nex">?</a> and <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> called <a class="wiki" href="tiki-directory_redirect.php?siteId=63" rel="">Sploids</a>. I am not we would use it for any robots as I am not sure it the K Nex, or Sploids moudling processes are as good as <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a>.
