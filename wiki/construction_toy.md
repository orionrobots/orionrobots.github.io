These are toys aimed at children yet have great value in creating robots. In
fact - building real robots with these toys has become a great educational aid
for teaching physics, electronics and many other subjects.

* [Lego](/wiki/lego.html "The best known construction toy") -
[MindStorms](/wiki/mindstorms.html "A Robotic construction toy system from Lego")
* [Lego RCX](/wiki/rcx.html "The Lego RCX")  
* Capsella  
* Mechano  
* [MegaBloks](/wiki/megabloks.html "A Cheaper alternative to Lego")  
* K Nex  
* FischerTechnik

Some people can get a little evangelical about only using a single construction
toy and not using any custom parts - but for the sake of building robots - it
may be better to swap and choose.

We have also recently come across an interesting idea allow the interconnection
of K Nex and [Lego](/wiki/lego.html "The best known construction toy") called
Sploids.
