Direct Current is also commonly shortened to DC.

It is an electrical current where the voltage flows in only one direction - this is the kind of voltage you would expect from a battery. Most electronic and [Robotic](/wiki/robotic.html "Robotic") applications require a DC Voltage to run them.

Its opposite is [Alternating Current](/wiki/alternating_current.html "Alternating Current").
