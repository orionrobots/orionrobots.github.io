Courtesy of The University of Berkeley, California   </div>These robots were built as learning platform by the late <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/william_grey_walter.html" title="William Grey Walter">William Grey Walter</a> in the 1940s.
<p>
<br/>They were phototropic - that is light following, and they were otherwise known as tortoises. A name derived from their plastic tortoise shaped shells, and a reference to <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1552977544/orionrobots-21" rel="external" target="_blank">Alice in Wonderland</a> - "We called him tortoise because he taught-us".
</p>
<p>The first two of these were named "Elmer" and "Elsie". They consisted of a light sensor, touch sensor, propulsion motor, steering motor, and a two vacuum tube analogue computer. The simplicity of its design now would be similar to the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/beam_robots.html" title="Biology, Electronics, Aesthetics and Mechanics">BEAM Robots</a>.
</p>
<p>A second generation was built - and some of these now reside in a collection in the Smithsonian Institute.
</p>
<p>There is currently a reconstructed Tortoise at the London Science Museum which actually performed in the Mind Zone of the Millennium Dome in Greenwich.
