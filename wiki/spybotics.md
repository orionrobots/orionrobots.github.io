These are designed for children to learn about spycraft, and robotics with <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a>.<div style="float:right; margin-left:5px; width:122px; height:92px"> <a class="internal" href="dl40&amp;display" rel="box[g]"> <img class="pluginImg40 img-responsive" height="90" src="dl40&amp;display&amp;x=120&amp;y=90" width="120"/> </a> </div>

<br/>Being part of the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/mindstorms.html" title="A Robotic construction toy system from Lego">Mindstorms</a> range, each set consists of a CD Rom , a Remote, a few peices and the SpyBotics Programmable Brick.
</p>
<p>The robots you can build are fairly interesting and colourful, going under such names as TechnoJaw, GigaMesh, SnapTrax and ShadowStrike. Each set comes with a different coloured remote and P-Brick pair.
</p>
<p>The remote operates in three modes. One is secure mode - which simply sets the channel the remote operates in, and broadcasts this to the P-Bricks - the first two of these channels also corresponds to <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego_manas.html" title="Remote control Lego robot-like kits">Lego Manas</a> channels. There is a control mode, which allows buttons 12 and 45 to control the movement of a P-Brick, or a <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego_manas.html" title="Remote control Lego robot-like kits">Lego Manas</a>. In this mode . There is also a game mode, where the control codes sent are used to play one of the CD-Rom challenges.
</p>
<p>The P-Brick is programmed from the PC via a VLL socket in the back - using two half pins to connect it, and a triangle polarity lock. When disconnected- the light can be used for decorative purposes - and often is in the modes on the brick, an dthe other sensor used as a light sensor.
</p>
<p>The P-Brick has two fixed motor outputs, a VLL output, an array of LED outputs, and a two IR outputs. It has a touch sensor input, two IR detectors, and a VLL input. The SpyBotics set can be programmed from MindScript and <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/nqc.html" title="Not Quite C - A Lego PBrick Programming Language">NQC</a>. It is also capable of controlling <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego_manas.html" title="Remote control Lego robot-like kits">Lego Manas</a> and communicating with the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego_rcx.html" title="The Lego RCX">Lego RCX</a> as well as other SpyBotics bricks.
