<p>These devices are commonly placed on input/sensor lines in <a a="" brain")="" class="wiki" for="" href="/wiki/microcontroller.html" robot"="" title="A programmable digital controller (or ">microcontrollers</a> to allow continously varying analog signals to be converted into binary signals.
</p>
<p>For example, an 8 <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/bit.html" title="Binary Digit">bit</a> ADC would convert the power levels to one of 256 numbers. This can then be easily interpreted by a program.
</p>
<p>It is using these, that the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego_rcx.html" title="The Lego RCX">Lego RCX</a> is able to have up to three light-sensors or similar devices connected. In the case of the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego_rcx.html" title="The Lego RCX">RCX</a> they have much better resolution than 8 bits, allowing for a more sensitive or greater range of variance.
</p>
<p>This can go an opposite way by using <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/dac.html" title="Digital To Analog Converter">DACs</a>.
