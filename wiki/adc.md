Abbreviation for Analog to Digital Converter.

These devices are commonly placed on input/sensor lines in [microcontrollers](/wiki/microcontroller.html) to allow continuously varying analog signals to be converted into binary signals.

For example, an 8 [bit](/wiki/bit.html "Binary Digit") ADC would convert the power levels to one of 256 numbers. This can then be easily interpreted by a program.

It is using these, that the [Lego RCX](/wiki/rcx.html "The Lego RCX") is able to have up to three light-sensors or similar devices connected. In the case of the [RCX](/wiki/rcx.html "The Lego RCX") they have much better resolution than 8 bits, allowing for a more sensitive or greater range of variance.

This can go an opposite way by using [DACs](/wiki/dac.html "Digital To Analog Converter").

A classic Arduino like the Uno has 6 exposed analog pins using internal ADCs allowing you to connect analog sensors.
