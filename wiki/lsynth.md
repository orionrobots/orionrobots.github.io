<p>LSynth is an <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/ldraw_system.html" title="The primary system for CAD representation of Lego parts">LDraw System</a> <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/cad.html" title="Computer Aided Design">CAD</a> tool. It allows generation of flexible items - like hoses, cables, rubber bands, tank treads and similar. It has (slightly buggy) object avoidance, and with positioning of parts using standard software like <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/mlcad.html" title="MLCad">MLCad</a> is quite easy to work with.
</p>
<p>It is currently the only tool of its kind for Lego that I am aware of - and can be very handy. Take a look at my <a class="wiki" href="tiki-download_file.php?fileId=5" rel="">Pneumatic Engine</a> for an example. All the hoses in the image have been generated with LSynth.
</p>
<p>The tool is available from the <a class="wiki" href="tiki-directory_redirect.php?siteId=44" rel="">LSynth Website</a> as well as the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/ldraw_system.html" title="The primary system for CAD representation of Lego parts">LDraw System</a> foundation.
<br/>You may note that he has an example pneumatic circuit which behaves in a similar way to mine.
