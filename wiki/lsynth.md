LSynth is an <a href="/wiki/ldraw_system.html" title="The primary system for CAD representation of Lego parts">LDraw System</a> <a href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> <a href="/wiki/cad.html" title="Computer Aided Design">CAD</a> tool. It allows generation of flexible items - like hoses, cables, rubber bands, tank treads and similar. It has (slightly buggy) object avoidance, and with positioning of parts using standard software like <a href="/wiki/mlcad.html" title="MLCad">MLCad</a> is quite easy to work with.

It is currently the only tool of its kind for Lego that I am aware of - and can be very handy. Take a look at my <a href="/assets/downloads/PneumaticEngineLSynth.mpd">Pneumatic Engine</a> for an example. All the hoses in the image have been generated with LSynth.

The tool is available from the <a href="http://lsynth.sourceforge.net/">LSynth Website</a> as well as the <a href="/wiki/ldraw_system.html" title="The primary system for CAD representation of Lego parts">LDraw System</a> foundation.

You may note that he has an example pneumatic circuit which behaves in a similar way to mine.
