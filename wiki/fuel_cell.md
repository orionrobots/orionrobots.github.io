<p>A fuel cell is an electro-chemical device that gets electrical power from oxidising hydrogen or hydrogen based compounds. It is a very efficient, if experimental power source.
</p>
<p>They are currently being developed for use in cars, as computer UPS's, and there are a fleet of fuel cell based London Busses.
</p>
<p>Because of the amount of power they give for their weight, and the abundance of hydrogen, they will make ideal <a href="/wiki/power_sources.html" title="Power Sources">Power Sources</a> for robots once they are a mature technology. They also lack the pollution issues of an <a href="/wiki/internal_combustion_engine.html" title="As used in the common automobile">Internal Combustion Engine</a>.
</p>
<p>Directly providing DC, like a simple battery means they are relatively simple to integrate in existing applications. Their are a number of kinds of fuel cell, characterised by the chemical and physical processes they use to generate power from the fuel. The most interesting is the Proton Exchange Membrane.
</p>
<p>To use these in mains power applications you will need to <a href="/wiki/generating_ac_from_dc.html" title="Generating AC From DC">Generate AC</a>.
