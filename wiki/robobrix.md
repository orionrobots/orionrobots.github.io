<p>RoboBrix are modular robot building components - with Wheel Bases, Grippers, <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/servo_motor.html" title="A motor with built in positioning control - easily interfaced with digital systems">Servos</a>, <a a="" brain="" class="wiki" for="" href="/wiki/microcontroller.html" robot="" title="A programmable digital controller (or ">MicroController</a>s, Sensors and an ever expanding line. In addition - they are mechanically compatible with the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> system.
</p>
<p>These have been in the pipeline for a while, and it is great that they are now commercially available, with more of the line on its way. I hope to convince a UK stockist to consider them.
</p>
<p>They are available for purchase currently at their home page - <a href="http://www.robobrix.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">http://www.robobrix.com/</a> via The Robot Store.
</p>
<p>They require soldering and some assembly. At their price they do compare fairly favourably with other <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/robot_kits.html" title="Robot Kits">Robot Kits</a>, and in terms of electronic expandability beat the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/rcx.html" title="The Lego RCX">Lego RCX</a> hands down. If you already have <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> and require a controller - I recommend looking at these first.
