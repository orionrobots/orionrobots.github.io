<p>Deferred design refers to a system with the ability to be modified or tweaked later.
</p>
<p>It best demonstrated by using MicroControllers or <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/fpga.html" title="Field Programmable Gate Array">FPGAs</a> which are programmable. This means that they could be deployed in an application - a robot, and later programmed, or reprogrammed as is necessary. They would be able to develop a design furthar, and actually test in the field without the expense of recreating new hardware for each iteration.
