<p>LeJOS is a replacement <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/os.html" title="An Operating System">OS</a> designed for programming the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego_rcx.html" title="The Lego RCX">Lego RCX</a> in a Java<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: Java">?</a> environment.
</p>
<p>This is more advanced than the standard firmware, which uses a bytecode interpreter anyway. It gives more control, and the ability to use Java code for those who are comfortable with this. C/C++ people should consider <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/brickos.html" title="An entire Embedded OS for the RCX">BrickOS</a>.
</p>
<p>Its firmware is essentially a tiny JVM<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: JVM">?</a> that weighs in at less than 32k, including the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/rcx.html" title="The Lego Robot Command Explorer">RCX</a> <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/api.html" title="Acronym: Application Programming Interface">API</a>. It is compatible with the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/serial_data_stream.html" title="Serial Data Stream">Serial</a> and <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/usb.html" title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</a> <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/ir.html" title="Acronym for Infra Red">IR</a> towers.
</p>
<p>It actually replaces the whole firmware of the system with a small (under 32k) JVM<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: JVM">?</a>. LeJOS also has the virtue of being an <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/open_source.html" title="Products and packages which are generally free.">Open Source</a> system, which means that anybody can use it freely, as well as viewing the code that it is built with, and extend it.
</p>
<p>The LeJOS developers are rumoured to be porting their code to the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/nxt.html" title="Legos NeXT generation robotics kit">NXT</a>.
</p>
<p>Java firstly allows you to use the full range of IDEs<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: IDE">?</a> you would for any Java code, as well as the help they give. It has a fairly comprehensive API which you can find detailed on their site with full JavaDOC documentation.
