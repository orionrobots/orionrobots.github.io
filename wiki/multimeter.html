<p>If you are building the electronic guts of many robots, you will often need to test circuit function and component values.
</p>
<p>Having, and knowing how to use a multimeter is an invaluable skill.
<br/>The first peice of advice I will offer any new robot builders is to buy a Digital one.  Analog ones are awkward to read, not very precise, and to be frank a bit obsolete.
</p>
<p>Entry level multimeters should cost no more than around Â£15 (less if you really look around at computer markets). They should also come with one set of probes - though eventually you might think about getting others. Also consider how many digits it will display - again- for entry level, four should be sufficient. If a manufacturer specifies 3.5 - they mean the first digit can only display a 1.
</p>
<p>Most multimeters have enough functionality to read resistance, current and voltage.
</p>
<p>Since resistors are one of the most common components you are working with - you will regularly use this one. All the settings marked with the Ohm Symbol &amp; are resistor markings. There are a set of different <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/resistor.html" title="Resistor">resistor</a> value ranges, so you try and go with the nearest one - or start low.  If you test the resistance, and see NO or 1, try shifting up to a higher setting.  Most go from 1&amp;ohm; (on the 2&amp;ohm; setting) up to 2M&amp;ohm; - this is a very high resistance, and although I have seen them, it is very rare you will use a resistor over this rating. For each setting- you are able to measure resistances less than, or equal to it. Some meters are "Auto-Ranging" - so you do not have to select a setting. Even if you are familiar with the resistor colour bands, I often check the resistance anyway, because some resistors (especially if salvaged) may be damaged and offer a much higher, or lower one than printed. If you are totally trusting of the colour bands, and do not check - you may find you have to desolder a dud.
</p>
<p>The next tool you will regularly use is continuity checking. It is often very worthwhile knowing if a circuit, or cable is clear-flowing and not broken. On some multimeters- you will have a specific setting, and an <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/led.html" title="Light Emitting Diode">LED</a> or Tone which sounds when the check is successful. On others- many of the entry-level ones, you can use the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/diode.html" title="Diode">diode</a> test functionality.

I prefer this rotary kind of MultiMeter. Ensure you buy a digital one like this as the analogue ones really do not live up to what a roboticist will require.  It is cheaper from Amazon than many local tool shops -  and has all of the beginner functions for measuring resistance, current and voltage. It also has Diode and Transistor testing.</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="even"> <a class="internal" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0859341844/orionrobots-21" target="_blank"> <img class="img-responsive" src="image58"/> </a> </td> <td class="even"><a  href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0859341844/orionrobots-21" rel="external" target="_blank">Getting the Most from Your Multimeter...</a></td> <td class="even">R.A.
