<p>This is basically a "Common or garden" <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/motor.html" title="Motor">motor</a>.  It might be referred to as a "Fixed Magnet DC Motor" as there are other motors which run on DC - this is just what is commonly meant when people simply say a motor or DC motor.
</p>
<p>It is operated by a <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/direct_current.html" title="Direct Current">Direct Current</a> and rotates in a direction set by the polarity of the current.
</p>
<h1  id="Components_of_a_DC_Motor">Components of a DC Motor</h1>
<p>The basic design of a DC motor requires an outer <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/stator.html" title="The Stationary magnetic component of a motor or generator">stator</a> (static/stationary part) which has two or more permanent magnets, a holder for the rotor axle, and brushes to pass electricity to the rotor.
</p>
<p>The rotor - rotating part has at least three electromagnets(more mean smoother operation) around a central axle.  The central axle also has a small ring with three(or more) contacts known as <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/commutators.html" title="A component of a DC Motor">commutators</a>.  As the motor rotates - the brushes on the stator connect with the commutator - and the motor changes polarity when the motor has turned - so the electromagnets polarities will change - this will attract them to the other stator magnet.

</p>
<p>The demonstration two electromagnet design is simple, and has limited efficiency and stability - professional motors are often a great deal more complex than this.
</p>
<p>Carbon is commonly used to lubricate the brushes on the commutators - as it is conductive (under some circumstances) while also being fairly hard wearing and not as messy as oil.

<h1  id="Control_Systems">Control Systems</h1>
<p>When using these, they may be crudely controlled by a switch and a <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/variable_resistor.html" title="A Resistor Which Can Be Controlled In Situ">Variable Resistor</a> - which will actually waste power as heat, or more efficiently by <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/pwm.html" title="Pulse Width Modulation">PWM</a> which is easily generated by a <a a="" brain")="" class="wiki" for="" href="/wiki/microcontroller.html" robot"="" title="A programmable digital controller (or ">MicroController</a>.
</p>
<p>If you want a simple direct control system, you may wish to consider [Servo Motors](/wiki/servo_motor) instead.
</p>
<h1  id="Smoothing">Smoothing</h1>
<p>When using DC motors with more complex control circuits, you may observe erratic or difficult to control behaviour. This is due to one of two factors.
</p>
<ul><li> DC Motors draw a lot of current, especially when starting up - this may actually drain it from the control circuitry, and starve it. It is therefore recommended you have a seperate power supply for these, and use a H-Bridge or <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/electronic_relay.html" title="An electrically activated switch">Electronic Relay</a> to control them.
</li><li> DC Motors may also introduce noise to a circuit - so it is recommended you use a <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/capacitor.html" title="Capacitor">Capacitor</a> in parallel to smooth the high frequency signals from the motor. This is even more critical in radio control applications where they can generate a lot of ambient noise. Be aware that if you are using <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/pwm.html" title="Pulse Width Modulation">PWM</a> to control the motor, then you must calculate the capacitance so as to damp noise, but not actually impede the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/pwm.html" title="Pulse Width Modulation">PWM</a> signal.
</li></ul><p>
<br/>If you are using motors on a device with ultrasonic sensors, the motors may also introduce a great deal of high frequency vibration - it is worth considering using suspension or damping foam around the Ultrasonic transducers to ensure it does not interfere with them.
</p>
<h1  id="Gearing">Gearing</h1>
<p>Standard DC motors are in no way geared, and this may mean that their output may be too fast with very low torque. You should probably gear them down a few times. This may be your problem if you attached your wheels directly to the motor shaft.
</p>
<p><a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> have both geared, and non-geared motor varieties.
