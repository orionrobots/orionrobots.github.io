That is - it acts in a vertical plane to maintain the height of the vehical. It is this that allows helicopters to  move in a very different way from a jet based plane. A jet, or forward based prop plane is not usually able to hover, or affect a vertical take of and landing (VTOL), with a few notable exceptions.

<div style="float:right; margin-left:5px; width:122px; height:111px"> <a class="internal" href="dl37&amp;display" rel="box[g]"> <img class="pluginImg37 img-responsive" height="109" src="dl37&amp;display&amp;x=120&amp;y=109" width="120"/> </a> </div> A helicopters rotor is a very specialist propellor, in that each blade can be individually orientated, so that the whole device can be tilted by the action of the propellor. This is achieved via a gimbal driving a swash plate. A swash plate is a fairly complicate bit of engineering.
<p>
<br/>Helicopters rarely have real wings, although the rotor blades themselves perform this function, however, they do have appendages that look like wings to mount instruments and devices on.

<p>The first Helicoptor was designed by <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/leonardo_da_vinci.html" title="Leonardo Da Vinci">Leonardo Da Vinci</a>, although it was never built. It was pedal powered.

<p>The smallest helicopter is a robotic one small enough to fit in the palm of your hand.
