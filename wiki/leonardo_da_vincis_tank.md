<p><a class="wiki" href="/wiki/leonardo_da_vinci.html" title="Leonardo Da Vinci">Leonardo Da Vinci</a> once designed a tank.  Although never built, it was ahead of its time.
</p>
<p>It had radial outward facing blunderbuss guns - for attack.  The top section could be seperated from the other(presumably for vision).
<br/>The wheels were very thin - arguably too thin without any tracks to have been useful.  Also in Leonardos drawings, it appears that the crank would be turning the wheels against each other - in opposition.
</p>
<p>But despite this - he was still many years ahead of the competition.  And looking at these sketches, and knowning Leonardo - there may have been more up his sleeve than we will ever know.

<p>It was made of wood, and would have been extremely difficult to move - makign it an easy target for hurled or machine launched weapons and artillery. Had it been made of metal - it would have offered better protection - but been completely impossible to move. Had steam engines been usable for locomation in his time, Leonardos tank would have been a winner. The basic principle was at least sound.
