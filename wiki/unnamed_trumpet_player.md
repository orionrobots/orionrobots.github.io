<br/>Toyota are currently developing an as-yet-unnamed robot that can play the trumpet.
</p>
<p>It is one the Toyota Partner Robots.
</p>
<p>It will be airing its musical abilities at the World Exposition in Aichi Japan in 2005.  Quite possibly with a whole robot band!
</p>
<p>It has already been showing off playing "When you wish upon a star" in a Tokyo hotel.
</p>
<p>It is around 120cm tall and can walk.
</p>
<p>Honda have not release any ther technical details yet.
</p>
<p>It has been designed apparently with assisting the elderly, and care at heart, as well as having hands to do many tasks.
</p>
<p>It weighs in at 35Kg.
</p>
<p>It can play trumpet by virtue of its advanced hands, and toyotas unique Lips - which are as versatile as human lips.  As Toyota puts it "Toyota developed artificial lips that move with the same finesse as human lips, which, together with robotsÃ¢Â€Â™ hands, enables the robots to play trumpets like humans do."
</p>
<p>It also appears that all of the actuators (Servo Motors) are housed in the torso - and wires(like human tendons) are used to transfer the movement to limbs - thus meaning the limbs are much lighter and more flexible.
