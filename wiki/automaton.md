<p>An Automaton is a kind of robotic toy. They tend to exhibit fairly complex and anthropomorphic (human or animal like) behaviour.
</p>
<p>They can range from <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/leonardo_da_vincis_robot.html" title="The Humanoid Robot Designed By Leonardo Da Vinci">Leonardo Da Vincis Robot</a> and Vaucansons Duck to victorian showboxes (a few of which can be found in the London waxworks), where a penny would see a small and spectacular piece of mechanical theatre.
</p>
<p>It could even be argued that more modern toys like the Tekno Robot Dog and <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/furby.html" title="Furby">Furby</a> are automatons - although by replacing extremely intricate and complex mechanisms with <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/pic.html" title="PIC">PICs</a> and multiple motors kind of takes some of the magic away.
</p>
<p>There have been automatons to handwrite.
</p>
<p>Al Jazari created a handwashing automaton.
</p>
<p>Because of the varied and ever growing nature of their complexity - the line between automaton, robot toy and robot and beginning to blur more.
