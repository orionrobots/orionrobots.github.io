An Automaton is a kind of robotic toy. They tend to exhibit fairly complex and anthropomorphic (human or animal like) behaviour.

They can range from [Leonardo Da Vincis Robot](/wiki/leonardo_da_vincis_robot.html "The Humanoid Robot Designed By Leonardo Da Vinci") and Vaucansons Duck to victorian showboxes (a few of which can be found in the London waxworks), where a penny would see a small and spectacular piece of mechanical theatre.

It could even be argued that more modern toys like the Tekno Robot Dog and [Furby](/wiki/furby.html "Furby") are automatons - although by replacing extremely intricate and complex mechanisms with [PICs](/wiki/pic.html "PIC") and multiple motors kind of takes some of the magic away.

There have been automatons to handwrite.

Al Jazari created a handwashing automaton.

Because of the varied and ever growing nature of their complexity - the line between automaton, robot toy and robot and beginning to blur more.
