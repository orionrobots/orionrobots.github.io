PC104 is a PC form factor, and bus specification for small stackable, scalable modules with varying processor technology - normally x86 compatible.

They allow more powerful computers to be used in robotic and engineering applications, and because of their form factor - upgrading, switching and using them is fairly simple.

Their biggest down point is the cost. At around 3 times the price of an ATX board, the [CPU](/wiki/microprocessor.html "Central Processing Unit") modules do not come cheap. Expect to see them drop dramatically in price over the coming years. Although the have the power of a general computing device, do not expect them to be as cheap, or easy to interface as a [PIC](/wiki/pic.html "PIC") or [MicroController](/wiki/microcontroller.html "A programmable digital controller (or ").

Their dimensions are 91.44 x 96.52mm, and stack at 15.24mm per module. They link together with spacers, and one J1 connector - an IDC style plug and socket arrangement. A Stack through module allows another layer to be placed above it, while a non-stackthrough terminates the block.

PC104 Plus is an extension allowing high speed PCI throughput on the bus. These 32 bit modules are backwards compatible with 8 and 16 bit PC104 modules.

When you are buying them -be aware of the difference between Compliant modules - which have the us and form factor, and Bus Compatible modules - which connect to the board - but DO not have the PC104 form factor.

For most hobby usage, this standard has been made obsolete by embedded computing systems like the Raspberry Pi.
