<p>It is, according to an amusing <a  href="http://www.lugnet.com/~330/FAQ/Fun/german" rel="external" target="_blank">contribution</a> to <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lugnet.html" title="Lego Users Group Network">Lugnet</a> the sound made when digging through <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> to find a particular peice.
</p>
<p>Pronouced - "Groo - shtell - ing" - it can be used as a word for searching for that one little peice you know is there but you just cant reach, like a 2x1 or a technic pin.
</p>
<p>More seriously - if you are using a great deal of <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> for building robots (with a <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/rcx.html" title="The Lego RCX">Lego RCX</a>) or other inventions - then you should probably seriously consider some more convenient <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/storage_systems.html" title="Where can you put all those robot bits?">Storage Systems</a>. Not only will it spare your (relatives) ears, but it will save you a great deal of time.
</p>
<p>One other method I have seen of avoiding this is to tip the whole lot onto the floor before starting- but then you only have to put them all back again - and you stand a good chance of loosing or damaging peices. Some people use a big circle of cloth with a tie - opening up the circle and spreading the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> on it, then closing it up with the Lego inside when finished.
</p>
<p>Either way- if you are going beyond the basics- then keeping it all in one big bucket/case is not a very good plan.
