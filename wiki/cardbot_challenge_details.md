<p>This challenge is to build a robot capable of taking a deck of cards, shuffling it, and then dealing cards off the top of the deck.

</p>
<p>It may sound easy - but its harder than you think. One of the first problems is accurately taking one card off the top of a deck - and ensuring its not two or three. Your robot will not need to know the value of the cards - but should be able to re-order them in a fairly random manner.

<div class="titlebar">Scoring</div>
<p>Points will be awarded for the following:
</p>
<ul><li> Size - A smaller robot will get more points
</li><li> Weight - A lighter robot will gain more points
</li><li> Power Consumption - Less power grabbing robots gain points. A robot powering itself via <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/solar_panel.html" title="Solar Panel">Solar Panels</a> may gain bonuses.
</li><li> Time Taken - The faster a robot can take a deck and shuffle it the better - though this is also weighed with how effective the shuffle was. A deck that is not well shuffled will lose points.
</li><li> Style - In the case of a tie - points will be awarded for interesting style and innovation.
</li></ul><p>When dealing cards - A user must be able to request X cards dealt from the top of the deck, and this number of cards must be dealt(no more or less). Speed is the main point winner here. Interfaces may simply be a button press per card, or a keypad with enter button - or go as far as speech recognition! The method of interaction here will go into the style category - as it is less important than  the MechaTronics of manipulating the cards themselves - but we still encourage innovation here.
</p>
<div class="titlebar">Other Notes</div>
<p>A competitor may use whatever materials they wish - barring off the shelf card machines. <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> is a good starting point for this.
<br/>Lo-Tek solutions are just as welcome as high tech ones - and may have a style advantage.
<br/>Robots must be able to complete their tasks unaided - apart from human interaction require to request cards to be dealt.
</p>
<p>We will be using standard playing cards for the challenge - so build your robot around those for dimensions - with a pack size of 52.

<p>
<br/>At OrionRobots our main goals are to encourage innovation and contact between local robot builders, a challenge does this, while getting you to start exploring and pushing your own (and orthers) technical knowledge. Following the challenge - we have a good excuse to sit down over a game of cards and discuss robotics.
