Most PCs come with this port, traditionally used for connecting printers, and sometimes hobbyist kits like our [Simple Parallel port LED Board]({% post_url 2004-11-05-simple-parallel-port-led %}) "How to attach and program an LED to the parallel port on a PC"). Some newer ones have however done away with this with the rise of the [USB](/wiki/universal_serial_bus.html "Universal Serial Bus") printers.

It uses (as the name implies) a [Parallel Data Stream](/wiki/parallel_data_stream.html "Parallel Data Stream").

In the table - when hardware inverted is yes, it means that when you write a 1 to this pin, it will output a 0, and vice versa.

In the past, this was used to connect many peripherals, like you would now use the IO pins of a Raspberry Pi or Arduino. You can learn to connect things to this, and program this port at our [Simple Parallel port LED Board](/2004/11/05/simple_parallel_port_led.html "How to attach and program an LED to the parallel port on a PC") article.

- [Jan Axelson's Parallel Port FAQ](http://janaxelson.com/jansfaq.htm) is somewhat helpful if you are having trouble with this.
- [Interfacing to The IBM-PC Parallel Printer Port](http://www.massmind.org/techref/io/parallel/par.html) A nice resource with a few more projects to try.
