<p>Locomotion is an important aspect of any mobile robot.  It is the robots ability to move.
</p>
<p>This part of the wiki is to discuss different techniques/methods of robot movement.
</p>
<p>The most basic is wheeled movement.  Although simple - it is a very effective method for flat, and mild terrain.  Not very useful for varying or rough terrain.  There are a number of methods of steering a mobile robot.

<p>Steering Systems and Transmissions:

<br/>One improvement(arguable) on wheels are caterpillar tracks.  They are much more suited to uneven terrain - and can(if done properly) give much better traction.  This is the locomotion system you commonly see on tanks, cranes and also is used by famous robots such as Jonny Five<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: Jonny Five">?</a>, RefBot, Sir Killalot<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: Sir Killalot">?</a> and many more.
