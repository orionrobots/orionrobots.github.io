Locomotion is an important aspect of any mobile robot. It is the robots ability to move.

This part of the wiki is to discuss different techniques/methods of robot movement.

The most basic is wheeled movement. Although simple - it is a very effective method for flat, and mild terrain. Not very useful for varying or rough terrain. There are a number of methods of steering a mobile robot.

Steering Systems and Transmissions:

- [Rack And Pinion](/wiki/rack_and_pinion.html "The steering system commonly used in cars")
- [Skid Steering](/wiki/skid_steering.html "Skid Steering")
- [Differential Gear](/wiki/differential_gear.html "Aka - Diff")
- Synchrodrive
- [Holonomic Wheels](/wiki/holonomic_wheels.html "Holonomic Wheels")
- [Tri Star Wheels](/wiki/tri_star_wheels.html "An advanced form of traction")
- Caterpillar Tracks
- [Adder Subtractor Drive](/wiki/adder_subtractor_drive.html "Adder Subtractor Drive")
- [Legs](/wiki/legs.html "Legs")

One improvement(arguable) on wheels are caterpillar tracks. They are much more suited to uneven terrain - and can(if done properly) give much better traction. This is the locomotion system you commonly see on tanks, cranes and also is used by famous robots such as Jonny Five, RefBot, Sir Killalot and many more.
