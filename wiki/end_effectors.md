<p>An End Effector is the part of a robot intended as a tool or attachment.
</p>
<p>It may be a simple gripper, or full hand with opposable thumb.  It also includes welding torches, soldering irons, cutters, lasers, paint/chemical sprays(or brushes), vacuums, drills, cleaning/buffing wheels or surgical instruments.
</p>
<p>They may also also include the business end of a BattleBot - Axes, Spikes, Flippers etc..
</p>
<p>Interchangeable end effectors can be an important feature in an adaptable multi-purpose robot. Although you would hope nobody designs a real robot wih such an embaressing intechange point as Kryten<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: Kryten">?</a>.
