<p>Genetics is a term applied to the system of evolution where changes in the data(mutations), can be selected for pure survivability over others.  These leads to Darwinian Evolution.

<p>DNA is the genetic material and consists of a chain of four bases abbreviated by the letters C T G and A. This chain is then matched against a counterpart known as RNA, which is then fed into the protein building factories of a cell to create molecules whic ofld in a  particular way and exhibit certain useful behaviours. From a robot builder or software engineers perspective - DNA is merely another programming system. Each gene is a small section of code which may influence one or more aspects of the development of a biological agent. However it is the concept of evolution to continually improve and revise it which is most intriguing.

<p>At the moment Orion is doing research into using a genetic code, and evolutionary algorithms to evolve robots for certain tasks.  The research revolves around using this with ClusterBots or SwarmBots which have one genetic code, but develop in a way similar to a hive. See <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/genetic_algorithm.html" title="Genetic Algorithm">Genetic Algorithm</a>. It can be surmised from this that its potential benefits in Robotics<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: Robotics">?</a> and <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/artificial_intelligence.html" title="Artificial Intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a> are great, and indeed has already been used there fairly well.
