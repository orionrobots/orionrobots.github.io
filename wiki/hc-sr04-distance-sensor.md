This is a simple but capable distance sensor - able to sense a 30 degree range, using 2 IO pins on your microcontroller.

It requires no soldering to get it working, and it needs 4 dupont cables to connect it directly to the Arduino so you can get trying distance measurement really quickly. It uses 5v logic.

This is what can be done with 2 of these, a few spare bits and an Explorer 1 kit:

{% assign yt_width="300" %}
{% assign yt_height="169" %}
{% assign youtube_id="ElXsXAcqrUE" %}
{% include no_iframe_youtube %}

Read this to work with it and an Arduino: [Arduino Basics: HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor](http://arduinobasics.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/arduinobasics-hc-sr04-ultrasonic-sensor.html)
