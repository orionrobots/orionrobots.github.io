<div style=" float: left;"><img alt="Lego NXT" class="img-responsive" src="/galleries/gallery-6-orions-images/359-mindstormsnxt.jpg"/> </div>The NXT is the current generation of <a href="/wiki/mindstorms.html" title="A Robotic construction toy system from Lego">Mindstorms</a> Lego <a href="/wiki/robot_kits.html" title="Robot Kits">robotics kit</a>.
The platform uses the "Liftarm" beam construction style - all pins and no lugs.

The block, arguably the "iPod" of robot kits, comes with <a href="/wiki/usb.html" title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</a> 2.0, <a href="/wiki/bluetooth.html" title="Bluetooth">BlueTooth</a> and plays audio.

The NXT brick has a dot matrix <a href="/wiki/lcd.html" title="Liquid Crystal Display">LCD</a> display, and can play simple audio files.

It has ports for four digital sensors. the kit comes with <a href="/wiki/sonar.html" title="The use of sound as a sense medium">Sonar</a>, Light, sound and touch sensors. There are additional third party sensors like colour sensors, compass sensors and others.

It has three output ports, and comes with three active <a href="/wiki/servo.html" title="Servo Motor">servo</a> motors which have position feedback, and can be used as rotation sensors too.

In terms of programming the NXT it comes with a visual "g" language based on Labview. However, Lego embraced the hacker community which grew around the RCX, and encouraged many other languages to be developed, so C compilers and so on are easily available.

Backwards compatibility with the <a href="/wiki/rcx.html" title="The Lego Robot Command Explorer">RCX</a> comes in the form of adaptor cables available on the Lego website.
