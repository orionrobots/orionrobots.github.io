A robot designed to participate in destructive robot games like [Robot Wars](/wiki/robot_wars.html "The british robot smashing TV series.").

Some people object to these being called robots as they posses little or no autonomy and intelligence.

OrionRobots will be building some of these at the [East Finchley Robotics Club](/wiki/east_finchley_robotics_club.html "East Finchley Robotics Club")
