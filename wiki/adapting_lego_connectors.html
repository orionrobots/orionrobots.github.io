It is expected that the RJ connectors may be orderable, and simply crimped.
<p>
<br/>These stud connectors can be used with <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> motors, sensors, the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/rcx.html" title="The Lego Robot Command Explorer">RCX</a> and <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/cybermaster.html" title="CyberMaster">Cybermaster</a>, as well as the Technic Control Centre and any other Lego part using the stud connector.
</p>
<p>Before you proceed with anything like this, bear in mind that you must still think safely. If you have not already done so, read <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/robot_building_safety.html" title="Building robots can be dangerous - tips to help your safety">Robot Building Safety</a> now.
</p>
<p>There are two basic ways to do this, the first is to cut into an original cable, and the second is to modify a brick to make your own connector.

<h2  id="Overview_2">Overview</h2>
<p>The most simple way to hook something into a <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> electronic device (like the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego_rcx.html" title="The Lego RCX">Lego RCX</a>), is to slice a lego cable, and then splice your device into the cable. Since you are cutting a connector in half, you get two adaptors this way.  The cables themselves are multicore, so you will probably need to tin them, and maybe even crimp them into a connector.
</p>
<h2  id="Materials_Required">Materials Required</h2>
<ul><li> Original <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> stud based power cable
</li><li> (Optional) 2 pin crimpable connector of your choice
</li><li> (optional) Electrical Insulating Tape
</li></ul><h2  id="Tools_Required">Tools Required</h2>
<p>For finding and selecting tools. please read <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/robot_tools.html" title="Tools that are often required to get started in robot building">Robot Tools</a>
</p>
<ul><li> Safety Goggles
</li><li> Wire Cutters
</li><li> Wire Strippers
</li><li> (Optional) Soldering Iron + Stand + Solder to tin cable
</li><li> (Optional) Helping Hands adjustable hobby clamp
</li><li> (Optional) Crimping tool
</li><li> (Optional) Sharp Craft Knife and Cutting mat
</li></ul><h2  id="Method">Method</h2>
<p>First, please wear your goggles, and make sure you are doing this on a well lit bench. If you intend to solder you must have good ventilation, and a soldering stand.
</p>
<p>Select a Lego cable, probably one of the shorter ones will do (since the long ones are less common and pretty useful intact). Cut it roughly in half.
</p>
<p>You may optionally split the two lines a little using the craft knife and cutting mat by pushing it down point first between the cables with the blade parallel to their length, about 20mm from the ends, and pulling it through, away from your body. You must be careful here not to bare the inside of one of the cables. You are advised to wrap both sides a little with the electrical tape to be sure there are not any exposed parts in the area you pulled it apart. You should probably put a small band of electrical tape around the neck of the split to prevent it splitting further up. If you are going to be using a connector, this step may be mandatory.
</p>
<p>Then, using the stripper, strip about 5mm bare on each cable, remembering to push the tool away from you, not towards you when you do so. Put a few twists in each bared section.
</p>
<p>You may now optionally tin them, which will keep them from tarnishing and make them easier to connect with other things. Tinning requires a soldering iron and a little solder, make sure you are still wearing goggles, and that you have a soldering stand before doing so, then melt a little solder on the tip of the iron. Clamp the wire into the helping hands, with the end free, then melt a little around the stripped part of the wire, taking care not to touch the tip of the soldering iron to the insulation - which will really smell if melted.
</p>
<p>If you wish to crimp it, then place each core into the crimpable connector, and crimp firmly with a suitable tool. Depending on the type of connector, you may want to use a little electrical tape to create a sleeve around the cable end of it.

<h2  id="Overview_3">Overview</h2>
<p>This gives a nice finish, and may be both cheaper and more flexible. Still using real <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> parts gives good compatibility. This does require soldering, and can be a little tricky as you are soldering onto very fine exposed metal areas and run the risk of melting plastic, which smells very bad.
</p>
<h1  id="Modifying_a_basic_brick">Modifying a basic brick</h1>
<h2  id="Overview_4">Overview</h2>
<p>This takes up more room than the previous two methods, but is less tricky in terms of soldering than the other two.  As 2x2 Basic bricks are abundant, it is very much cheaper than any of the other methods. This can be achieved with stiff wire or 4mm cheese head screws, but they are more fiddly than this method. This method involves salvaging tin from a biscuit tin, and actually modifying the studs, so the potential for compatibility problems is increased.

<p><a class="wiki" href="tiki-view_forum_thread.php?topics_offset=1&amp;forumId=8&amp;comments_parentId=108" rel="">MindSensors</a> also have a method, where they use a <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/pcb.html" title="Printed Circuit Board">PCB</a> moulded to fit over the contact studs - this has to be the most elegant we have seen yet. You will need a service who can drill and form PCBs for you, but they are becoming increasingly common.
</p>
<h1  id="Other_methods">Other methods</h1>
<p>There are probably plenty more methods, and variations on these. Please log in, and add your comments or links to this page if you have another method, or enhancements to a method here.
</p>
<h1  id="Considerations">Considerations</h1>
<p>Be aware, that as Lego connectors are not polarised - you may(or may not) wish to add diodes to maintain the correct polarity.  You can use a single diode to allow one way only usage, or use a <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/diode_bridge.html" title="Diode Bridge">Diode Bridge</a> to allow any orientation.
