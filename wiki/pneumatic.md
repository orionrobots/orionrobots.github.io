In some situations it is a much easier or better system than electronic motors or solenoids. A good example is when used in a situation with flammable substances or requiring very large forces.

A <a href="/wiki/solenoid.html" title="Solenoid">Solenoid Valve</a> is normally required to interface Pneumatic systems to electronic systems.

Pneumatic systems can include pressure sensors, <a href="/wiki/pistons.html" title="Pistons">Pistons</a>, as well as Pneumatically and Electrically operated <a href="/wiki/solenoid.html" title="Solenoid">Solenoid</a> valves.

It is possible to build fully automated systems with pneumatic components, which will function as long as air is supplied. Here is an example designed by us [Pneumatic Engine Design]({% link _posts/2006-07-09-pneumatic-engine-repost.md %}) - including full <a href="/wiki/ldraw_system.html" title="The primary system for CAD representation of Lego parts">LDraw System</a> instructions.

A good alternative for larger scale applications is <a href="/wiki/hydraulic.html" title="Hydraulic">Hydraulic</a> systems.
