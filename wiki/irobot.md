This group is behind the <a href="/wiki/roomba.html" title="A Robotic vacuum cleaning system">roomba</a> and My Real Baby and was founded, among others, by <a href="/wiki/rodney_brooks.html" title="Rodney Brooks">Rodney Brooks</a> of <a href="/wiki/mit.html" title="Massachussetts Institute of Technology">MIT</a>.

The robots they produced are based on the multi-level subsumption architecture demonstrated for many years by Brooks and his team.

They are based in Massecheusets, US. Take a look at the <a href="http://www.irobot.co.uk/">iRobot Website</a>.
