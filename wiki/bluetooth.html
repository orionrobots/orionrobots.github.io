<p>It uses a <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/serial_data_stream.html" title="Serial Data Stream">Serial Data Stream</a> system and has fairly short range of up to a few meters.  The secure element is entirely up to the implementation and may not be present at all. It is fairly limited in the types of communications it supports, but the ability to support a virtual serial port is its strength. At its cost, and the high barrier of entry for development, it is currently mroe economical for a robot developer to look at more simple wireless serial port pairs, or a basic <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/rc.html" title="Remote Control">RC</a> protocol.
