Chaos 2 was one of the most infamous, and formidable flipper bots from the original UK Robot Wars.

It was immensely powerful, and was a reigning champion of <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/robot_wars.html" title="The british robot smashing TV series.">Robot Wars</a> for some time. It also appears a little more compact than some robots - meaning there was less room for things to fall off and rattle.  In an impact - the less moving stuff you have, the better your chances are(okay - thats vastly simplifying it - but hollow spaces are more easily broken).

It used <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/pneumatic.html" title="Use of air to operate and power actuators">pneumatic</a> compressed gas systems to fire off its flipper, and boy did it fire, in fact, it was capable launching other robots out of the arena.

I wonder what George Francis will be doing next?
