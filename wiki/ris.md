<p>The RIS kit from <a href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">lego</a> was the one that contained the <a href="/wiki/rcx.html" title="The Lego Robot Command Explorer">RCX</a> along with the <a href="/wiki/ir.html" title="Acronym for Infra Red">IR</a> tower, a number of elements to build with, a neat construction guide and multimedia CD.
</p>
<p>It was pretty much the set that really started many people on the path to having robotics as their major hobby. and introduced <a href="/wiki/mindstorms.html" title="A Robotic construction toy system from Lego">mindstorms</a>. The set was a turning point and vastly lowered the barrier to entry.
</p>
<p>It is set to be replaced by the <a href="/wiki/nxt.html" title="Legos NeXT generation robotics kit">NXT</a> in Q3/4 2006.
</p>
<p>There were four releases of the RIS (1.0(a and b), 2.0 and 3.0), each with slightly revised software and different bricks, multiplied by the locale/language specific versions of these. The earlier 1.0 set (of which there were actually two versions anyway) was sought after for its inclusion of a 9v power socket on the <a href="/wiki/rcx.html" title="The Lego Robot Command Explorer">RCX</a> brick itself, which was subsequently removed. The 1.0 version shipped with a <a href="/wiki/serial_data_stream.html" title="Serial Data Stream">serial port</a> based tower.
</p>
<p>The 2.0 Version shipped with a USB tower, revised firmware on the RCX brick and updated software, although the software updates were available for download separately for free on the <a href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> <a href="/wiki/mindstorms.html" title="A Robotic construction toy system from Lego">mindstorms</a> website.
