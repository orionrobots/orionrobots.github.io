<p>I sometimes have ideas, which may or may not be patentable processes. They are all licensed as Creative Commons by-nc-sa 2.0 license (as detailed at the bottom of every page).
<br/>While some of them are robot related - many of them are simply technological and social innovations. While I beleive that none of them existed previously - please feel free to correct me - and provide with links. If I thought it was a good idea, I am happy to promote someone else who does too!
<br/>I have not included anything like specific <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> or robot designs here - they are elsewhere in the site.

<br/>I also back Bill Thompsons idea of internet education (as opposed to censorship) for youngsters - <a  href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3992037.stm" rel="external" target="_blank">BBC News - Why The Web is Not a Safety Net</a>
