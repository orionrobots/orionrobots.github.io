<p>I am Danny Staple, otherwise known as Orion.
<br/>I am the creator and maintainer of OrionRobots, and have authored most of its content.
</p>
<p> <a class="internal" href="browseimage326"> <img class="img-responsive" src="image326&amp;thumb=1"/> </a>
</p>
<p>I am a hobby robot builder who likes to build with anything I can get my hands on, including hacking old toys, building stuff from scratch or just using <a href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a>. I am also an experienced Software Engineer with BCS Membership. It is between there and OrionRobots that I do some Open Source work, including trying to make a worthwhile contribution to <a  href="http://www.tikiwiki.org" rel="external" target="_blank">TikiWiki</a> - The software OrionRobots is based upon.
</p>
<p>I live in West London, but have been living in and around London for many years. I was born in the UK, and don't really see myself living in another country in the forseeable future. Therefore, if you detect a UK preference in my articals, or find I use english spelling, you now know why.
</p>
<p>I have fairly varied music tastes, but generally satisfy those with <a  href="http://last.fm" rel="external" target="_blank">http://last.fm</a> and <a  href="http://soma.fm" rel="external" target="_blank">http://soma.fm</a> online stations when I have the bandwidth.
</p>
<p>I occasionally post on <a href="/wiki/lugnet.html" title="Lego Users Group Network">Lugnet</a> and lurk on the Lugnet Robotics group daily, as well as DPRG, the OOPic mailing list and a few others. You may also spot me if you attend any London BCS meetings, or DorkBotLondon events.
