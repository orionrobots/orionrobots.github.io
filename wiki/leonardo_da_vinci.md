As a reneissance artist, inventor and scientist, he lived a hundred or more years ahead of his time.  He was born on April 15, 1452 in Vinci, Italy.  Hence "Da Vinci" - translates of "Of Vinci" - a town just outside Florence.  His full name was, in fact, "Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci" - Leonardo - Son of Piero of Vinci.  His father was a wealthy  and renowned man in the area.<br/>
