<p>William Grey Walter built one of the first robotic turtles in the 1940s.
</p>
<p>He was born Missouri on the 19th Feb, 1910 and grew up in England. As a Cambridge student and one of the most distinguished neurophysiologists of his day, he was responsible for the electroencephalograph. A machine which measures brain waves. With the machine he was able to study different patterns from the brain - for example those which indicated when a person is learning.
</p>
<p>His studies brought him to creating robots as simple artificial brains to study behaviour. The AI he created was a small mobile robot with a plastic shell - which acted as a bump sensor. It was phototropic - it could follow light. It was nicknamed the tortoise or turtle - because of its plastic shell - giving the appearance, and because of the explanation of mock-turtle in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1552977544/orionrobots-21" rel="external" target="_blank">Alice in Wonderland</a> - "We called him tortoise because he taught us". Walter expected to learn a lot from his machines.
</p>
<p>Walters work inspired <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/rodney_brooks.html" title="Rodney Brooks">Rodney Brooks</a> through his attempts to give his machine a basic artificial awareness, and gave them a genus species zoological name of <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/machina_speculatrix.html" title="Early robots built by a pioneer">Machina Speculatrix</a> literally meaning the machine that watches. The simple stimuli-response mechanism of the robot emulated many real creatures. As Walter put it himself - "it explores its environment actively, persistently, systematically, as most animals do".
</p>
<p>He followed up the first generation with a later version - the &lt;i&gt;Machina docilis&lt;/i&gt; - the teachable machine. This robot "learned" to react to whistles. This system of using a few simple rules to create an emergent complex behaviour is exactly that used by many sucessful robot creators now, and is the basis of robots like <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/ghengis.html" title="Ghengis">ghengis</a>.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Walter was injured in car accident in 1970, he never fully recovered and passed away at the age of 67 on the 6th May 1977.
</p>
<p>Walter gave his robots individual names- the first two were Elmer and Elsie, who were sadly cannibalised to create a furthar 6 tortoises with the aid of his colleague "Bunny" Warren.

<p>Below is an image of William Grey Walter working on one of the robots, with a turtle shaped shell behind that gives it the name.
