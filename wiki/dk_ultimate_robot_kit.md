<p>This is a rather nifty little kit for teaching children about the basics of robotics. Using cardboard and paper - yes you hear me, along with a couple of paperclips, some PVA glue and some lengths of foil - you can create four robots each of which have very different functions.
</p>
<p>One of them is a "Knotbot" which can be programmed to follow a simple course by tieing nots in a length of string. These robots are small, ingenious, and perfectly safe for younger learners. Of course - being paper and card means they will not last, and once they have been built, and the accompanying information thoroughly consumed, it is worth graduating them to <a href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> for more robot building.
