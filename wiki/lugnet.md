<p>Lugnet is an acronym for the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> Users Group Network
</p>
<p>The website hosts a very large global community of <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> enthusiasts.  If you are at all a fan of <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a>, it is probably worth a visit.
</p>
<p>Even if you are not interested in <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a>, they have a few active newsgroups on robotics topics which will probably be of interest. These groups can be visited on the web, as newsgroups (in Usenet style) or subscribed to as a mailing list, which can be posted to. While the subscription and posting to can be awkward, it is worth persevering as the groups like <a  href="http://news.lugnet.com/build/mecha" rel="external" target="_blank">.build.mecha</a> and <a  href="http://news.lugnet.com/robotics" rel="external" target="_blank">.robotics</a> are more than worth it.
</p>
<p>There are a number of localised Lugnet groups, like <a  href="http://news.lugnet.com/loc/uk" rel="external" target="_blank">.loc.uk</a>, a UK group. These contain discussions related to local events, or local signs ups etc. They are a very good place to keep an eye on if you want to keep up with, or meet up with your peers.
</p>
<p>The <a  href="http://news.lugnet.com/dear-lego" rel="external" target="_blank">.dear-lego</a> group is superb for getting in touch with The Lego Company themselves, and seeing the kind of gripes or requests that <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego.html" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> users have made. The <a  href="http://news.lugnet.com/announce" rel="external" target="_blank">.announce</a> groups are there for announcing new events, or models (MOC - my own Creations) that people have created. These announce post groups do not normally allow responses, and models tend to be cross-posted to more specific groups, like <a  href="http://news.lugnet.com/build/mecha" rel="external" target="_blank">.build.mecha</a>, <a  href="http://news.lugnet.com/space" rel="external" target="_blank">.space</a> or <a  href="http://news.lugent.com/technic" rel="external" target="_blank">.technic</a> for example.
</p>
<p>They also have a list and guide to most Lego parts and sets - with pictures.  Used with <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/peeron.html" title="Online database of Lego Sets and Parts">Peeron</a> they are an invaluable resource.
