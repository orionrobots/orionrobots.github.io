<p>When working with <a href="/wiki/binary.html" title="The storage method for digital information">binary</a> information, these gates allow a number of simple, yet powerful operations to be carried out. They operate on digital information at the <a href="/wiki/bit.html" title="Binary Digit">BIT</a> level using <a href="/wiki/boolean.html" title="Boolean">boolean</a> logic.
</p>
<p>These basic gates, can be combined in massive numbers to provide the kind of functionality you take for granted on the computer you are viewing this page with right now.
</p>
<p>The basic operations are <a href="/wiki/not.html" title="NOT">NOT</a>, <a href="/wiki/and.html" title="AND">AND</a> and <a href="/wiki/or.html" title="OR">OR</a>, from which more complex operations like <a href="/wiki/nand.html" title="Negated AND">NAND</a>, NOR and <a href="/wiki/xor.html" title="XOR">XOR</a> can be constructed.
