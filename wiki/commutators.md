<p>Commutators are the curved copper plates around the armature of a <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/dc_motor.html" title="DC Motor">DC Motor</a> - with insulating material between them. They are also used in Generators, and some older switching systems(though those may have been replaced by solid state gear).
</p>
<p>These plates are in contact with the brushes which allow them to transmit power from the source to the coil windings.

<p>In a <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/dc_motor.html" title="DC Motor">DC Motor</a>, as the commutators move past the brushes their polarities change, therefore changing the polarity of the magnetic fields of the coils.
