<p>There are many types of motor:

</li><li> <a href="/wiki/dc_motor.html" title="DC Motor">DC Motor</a>s
</li><li> Brushless Motors
</li><li> <a href="/wiki/stepper_motors.html" title="Stepper Motors">Stepper Motors</a>
</li><li> Linear Motors
</li><li> AC Motors
</li></ul><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>They generally consist of a minimum of a moving section (rotor) and a static (stator) section.  One or both of which has an Electro Magnet, and the other may or may not contain permenant magnets.
<br/>One important consideration when using any motor is its <a href="/wiki/torque.html" title="Torque">Torque</a> as well is its Electrical Current and Electrical Voltage requirements.
