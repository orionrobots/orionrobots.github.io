<p>In theory, this form of memory can only be written to once, and is from that point on etched in stone - as it were. Realistically - very few forms of ROM are actually that fixed. It is more common these days to see <a href="/wiki/eeprom.html" title="Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM">EEPROM</a> or <a href="/wiki/flash_memory.html" title="Flash Memory">Flash Memory</a> in use.
</p>
<p>ROM is commonly used to store low-level programs, for example the code to boot up a system like a PC BIOS. In the early days of computing, many programs were distributed on ROM Chips and even now, in a number of consoles - the cartridge system is exactly that.
</p>
<p>The acronym was chosen, because it fits nicely with its counterpart <a href="/wiki/ram.html" title="Random Access Memory">RAM</a>.
