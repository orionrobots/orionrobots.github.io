<p>A table showing the operation of a <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/boolean.html" title="Boolean">Boolean</a> logic gate, or combination of them.
</p>
<p>This works for simple cases - where you show the input lines and output lines, but cannot address any time based or more complex changes.
</p>
<p>Then you show each input permutation (combination) and the output this would yield.
</p>
<p>A good example is the table for the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/not.html" title="NOT">NOT</a> gate.
