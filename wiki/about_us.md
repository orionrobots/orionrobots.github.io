title: About Us
---
OrionRobots is a company based upon providing information and education about technology and robotics 
to any who are interested. The goals are ultimately advancement and enjoyment of such technology. We are
more about bodging something that would work and someone can try out themselves, than crafting perfect
solutions. Learning, playing and then teaching and mentoring is how we do things.

The website incorporates a number of sources and types of information, including factual information 
and statistics, tutorials and walkthroughs, a directory of related material, forums for public 
discussion, news and articals, and also blogs on opinions and viewpoints.

Through such a collection we hope to create a rounded view of technology, and make it easy for 
those trying to learn robotics, or even those who are on the cutting edge, to find what they need, 
and share their experiences with others.

An experience shared is an experience enhanced.
