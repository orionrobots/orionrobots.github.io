<p>These are similar in function to <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/agv.html" title="Automated Guided Vehical">AGV's</a>. They are designed generally for reconaissancel, but could and have been deployed offensively. They may also be used to take supplies over otherwise hostile terrain.
</p>
<p>They have been used for some time by the US Military, and also have been picked up on by <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/sci_fi_robots.html" title="Sci Fi Robots">sci-fi series</a> like Stargate SG1<a class="wiki wikinew for-review" title="Create page: Stargate SG1">?</a>.

<p>They tend to mostly have cameras, and use telemtry for control - so although unmanned, they are not really automated yet. Processing terrain is fairly difficult to acheive, although that technology has been used in guided missiles for a long time. Many guided missiles could therefore be though of as kinds of UAV's which in turn are kinds of robots.
