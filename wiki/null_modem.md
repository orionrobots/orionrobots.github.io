<p>Sometimes when connecting computer systems and peripherals, you need to create a particular kind of cable for <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/serial_data_stream.html" title="Serial Data Stream">Serial</a> connections.
</p>
<p>The "Null-Modem Cable" is so called because it is used on the serial ports without a modem, for machine to machine communication. The cable simply has the Rx (receive) and Tx (Transmit) lines crossed - so the two machines talk directly to each other.
</p>
<p>You may find this necessary to connect to some MicroControllers and accessories.
