The infamous British robot battling show, once hosted by <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/craig_charles.html" title="Craig Charles">Craig Charles</a> where robots smash each other in a ring.

It has served the community well, by publicising and improving the image of such events. It has made hobbyist robotics something that your average TV junkie is now vaguely aware of. The show is not currently running a series at the moment, and the nearest you will see to it are the XFM - Xtreme Fighting Machines events, which are live, but not on TV.

There are some interesting technical merits here, but OrionRobots hopes that they would host TechnoGames more often.

All of the robots in Robot Wars are <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/rc.html" title="Remote Control">remote controlled</a> - and do not feature any real <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/artificial_intelligence.html" title="Artificial Intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a> or <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/autonomous.html" title="Autonomous">Autonomy</a>.  After all - with weapons like that - it could be very dangerous if any of them did!

The DVD's feature huge numbers of battles, as well as under the hood and many extras. If you are building - you could use this to your advantage to study the weapons, weaknesses and strategies of other teams.</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="even"> <a class="internal" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008UEMW/orionrobots-21" target="_blank"> <img class="img-responsive" src="image80"/> </a> </td> <td class="even"> <a  href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008UEMW/orionrobots-21" rel="external" target="_blank">Robot Wars: Arenas of Destruction... - PC CD Rom</a> </td> <td class="even"> If you are interested in robots, battling robots and similar - but you are not quite ready to make the step into building your own yet, you could always live it out in this PC game. There are versions for other platforms. Although it is fun, and some degree of robot customization is available - it doesnt have anything on the real thing.</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="odd"> <a class="internal" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006LJZI/orionrobots-21" target="_blank"> <img class="img-responsive" src="image81"/> </a> </td> <td class="odd"> <a  href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006LJZI/orionrobots-21" rel="external" target="_blank">Robot Wars 2 - Extreme Destruction</a> </td> <td class="odd"> This Gameboy Advance title is good fun. In a workshop system - you must consider the normal power, vs armour, vs weight, vs offense trade-offs, you get to battle robots (including the house-robots) in a number of interesting arenas in simple 3D. You eventually get to design your own arenas. Once you have unlocked(by battling) a number of good mods, and designed a good robot - you can use these in battles with other players with a link cable. This is also available for the X-Box and PC.</td> </tr> <tr> <td class="even"> <a class="internal" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006BT9P/orionrobots-21" target="_blank"> <img class="img-responsive" src="image176"/> </a> </td> <td class="even"> <a  href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006BT9P/orionrobots-21" rel="external" target="_blank">Robot Wars - Sir Killalot And The House Robots</a> </td> <td class="even"> See the best (and worst) moments of the house robots in this excellent DVD.</td> </tr> </table>
