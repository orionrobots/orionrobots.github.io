<p>This device was commonly used on the output lines of a <a a="" brain")="" class="wiki" for="" href="/wiki/microcontroller.html" robot"="" title="A programmable digital controller (or ">MicroController</a>. However - more often <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/pwm.html" title="Pulse Width Modulation">PWM</a> techniques have now replaced them.

<p>It would convert a digital binary signal, to an output power level. With an 8 <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/bit.html" title="Binary Digit">bit</a> DAC, you could output 256 varying levels of power (including 0 - off).
</p>
<p>It is worth pointing out that the <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/lego_rcx.html" title="The Lego RCX">Lego RCX</a> does not have DAC outputs, but <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/pwm.html" title="Pulse Width Modulation">PWM</a> outputs. You should bear this in mind if you are designing custom output devices for it. An analog result may be obtained by using a <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/capacitor.html" title="Capacitor">capacitor</a> or other intermediate control circuits.
