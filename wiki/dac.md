This device was commonly used on the output lines of a [MicroController](/wiki/microcontroller.html "A programmable digital controller (or "). This is frequently approximated with [PWM](/wiki/pwm.html "Pulse Width Modulation"). PWM is perfectly suited to control the sped of motors, or the brightness of LED's.

It converts a digital binary signal to an output voltage level. With an 8 [bit](/wiki/bit.html "Binary Digit") DAC, you could output 256 varying levels of power (including 0 - off).

Most controllers (e.g. the Arduino) do not have DAC outputs, but [PWM](/wiki/pwm.html "Pulse Width Modulation") outputs. An analog result may be obtained by using a [capacitor](/wiki/capacitor.html "Capacitor") or other intermediate control circuits.
