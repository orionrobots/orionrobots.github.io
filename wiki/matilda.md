Matilda is a quirky House Robot on [Robot Wars](/wiki/robot_wars.html)  Of course the big difference is that she is the only House Robot considered female. She has seen many battles - and taken damage more than once. She has also been completely rebuilt a few times - most infamously after Razer pulverized her.

She is based upon a battery driven engine that can go at around 8mph, and weighs in at around 116 kilos - compared with <a href="{% post_url 2005-03-01-sir-killalot %}">Sir Killalot</a> this makes her a lightweight. She is 66cm wide by 66cm high and 140cm long.

Her fibreglass shell is an easy target - but her lifting jaw is fairly powerful. She has a sting in her interchangeable chainsaw tail - although her vertical flywheel is seen more often recently. To be honest though - I would be more worried about Sir Killalot or <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/mr_psycho.html" title="Mr Psycho">Mr Psycho</a>. Because of her low weight, she has been flipped a few times as well.

Her design is reminiscent of a triceratops crossed with a stegosaurus - although her collar has a slight hint of Ming The Merciless.

<td> This Gameboy Advance title is good fun. In a workshop system - you must consider the normal power, vs armour, vs weight, vs offence trade-offs, you get to battle robots (including the house-robots) in a number of interesting arenas in simple 3D. You eventually get to design your own arenas. Once you have unlocked(by battling) a number of good mods, and designed a good robot - you can use these in battles with other players with a link cable. This is also available for the X-Box and PC.</td>
