Doing anything alone is not as much fun as being part of a community of people, 
or going to where a large crowd are enjoying robots doing something interesting or spectacular.

We are starting to collect some events, clubs and societies here. 
Please contact us if you have robotics, maker or electronics events you'd like us to mention here.
