It is a broad covering definition of the concepts that may make a machine appear to be or actually be behaving intelligently.
There are many techniques which fall under this banner

* Machine Learning
    * Artificial Life
    * [Genetic Algorithms](/wiki/genetic_algorithm.html "Genetic Algorithm")
    * Neural Networks
* Natural Language Processing
* Subsumption Architecture
* Expert Systems

A system does not necessarily have to learn to be considered AI, hence the distinct term Machine Learning.
