    <p>Hi!</p>

    <p>Don''t worry,</p>

    <p>It''s just an indication that the datalog of the <a class="wiki wiki_page"
    href="Lego+RCX" title="The Lego RCX">RCX</a> has been used.

    </p>

    <p>When you change your batteries -and wait a while between change- it will be
    gone.</p>

    <p>The datalog is a useful option of the <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="Lego+RCX"
    title="The Lego RCX">RCX</a> but at this moment it''s only been used by <a class="wiki
    wiki_page" href="NQC" title="Not Quite C - A Lego PBrick Programming Language">NQC</a>.

    </p>

    <p>I am not sure here - but could that mean that the batteries are seriously

    <br/>low?

    </p>

    <p>It would seem likely if they have been sat for a while, as even when

    <br/>powered down there is some residual current usage, and leakage in the RCX.

    <br/>Remember that when batteries are changed, you have a minute to replace

    <br/>them otherwise you must re-flash the firmware and re-upload any programs.

    </p>

    <p>Cheers,

    <br/>Danny

    <br/>&gt; G''day,

    <br/>&gt; I have been using my RCX 2.0 brick recently after it has been laying
    idle

    <br/>&gt; for a

    <br/>&gt; period.  I have noticed that there is an extra icon in the display window

    <br/>&gt; which

    <br/>&gt; is not discussed in the Lego Robotics Invention System 2.0

    <br/>&gt; Constructopedia.  I

    <br/>&gt; was hoping someone could explain what it means.

    <br/>&gt;

    <br/>&gt; Next to the program number I can see a flashing quarter of a circle.  The

    <br/>&gt; quarter flashes after I press the on button and continues to flash which

    <br/>&gt; ever

    <br/>&gt; program I have running.

    <br/>&gt;

    <br/>&gt; I have used BrixCC in the past however, I using the lego supplied

    <br/>&gt; programming

    <br/>&gt; tool at present.  The Lego Firmware is loaded in my RCX.

    <br/>&gt;

    <br/>&gt; Grateful for any advice.

    <br/>&gt; Regards

    <br/>&gt; Ian Reid

    <br/>&gt; &gt;

    </p>
