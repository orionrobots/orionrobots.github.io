    <p>When is the RIS 3.0 coming out? Nobody probably will know, but a general

    <br/>idea will work, like what year...

    <br/>&gt; Is there really going to be an <a href="Lego+RCX"
    title="The Lego RCX">RCX</a> 3.0? If so, when will it be released?

    <br/>&gt;

    </p>

    <p><a href="Lego" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a>
    are planning to create one. The details of its release date, and

    <br/>specifications are not clear yet - but it may be more of a revision than

    <br/>the ones before - which were pretty much firmware changes and the removal

    <br/>of the external power connector.

    </p>

    <p>There is hope that the power connector will come back in the <a class="wiki
    wiki_page" href="Lego+RCX" title="The Lego RCX">RCX</a> 3 though.

    <br/>The forum to watch on this is probably <a href="https://www.lugnet.com/robotics/"
    rel="">Lugnet Robotics</a> who will probably be the first to hear

    <br/>about it, and have already been discussing it somewhat.
