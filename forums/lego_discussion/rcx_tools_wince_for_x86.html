    <p>AFAIK - there is an <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="NQC" title="Not Quite C
    - A Lego PBrick Programming Language">NQC</a> port which runs under WinCE
    - although it may be interesting to see how you will transfer the programs.

    </p>

    <p>Some, but not all <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="PDA" title="Personal Data
    Assistant">PDA</a> and WinCE boxes have <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="IR" title="Acronym
    for Infra Red">IR</a> ports which can encode signals the <a class="wiki wiki_page"
    href="RCX" title="The Lego Robot Command Explorer">RCX</a> can use, although the
    tool you have in mind only supports an interesting arrangement of Null-Modem cables
    connected to the tower.

    </p>

    <p>Anyway - the binaries, and contact information for that is here:

    <br/><a class="wiki external" href="http://www.rainer-keuchel.de/rcx/rcx.html"
    rel="external">http://www.rainer-keuchel.de/rcx/rcx.html</a>

    </p>

    <p>There appear to be what might by wince-x86 binaries, but do contact the page
    owners there if you cannot find the exact build you want.

    </p>

    <p>Cheers,

    <br/>Orion
