    <br/>&gt; This summary of the Robolab add-on &amp; pricing:

    <br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.teachers.ash.org.au/dbrown/robolab/availr.htm">http://www.teachers.ash.org.au/dbrown/robolab/availr.htm</a>

    <br/>&gt;

    <br/>&gt; has at the very bottom, a "Waterproof housing for a single RCX"

    <br/>&gt; ($118.00)  "This enables the user to use the RCX underwater."

    <br/>&gt;

    <br/>&gt; Anyone know what this is referring to or have experience with it?

    <br/>&gt;

    <br/>No - but I would buy one! I take it the U is for U-Boat? Imagine being

    <br/>able to build Lego subs... I have only ever dreamt of such things...

    </p>

    <p>Nothing refering to it on peeron or in any of the Uk robolab retailers

    <br/>though... Please let us know if anyone finds one!
