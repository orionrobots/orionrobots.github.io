    <p>Hi all:

    </p>

    <p>I am trying to build the adder/subtractor robot listed at <a href="http://www.mapageweb.umontreal.ca/cousined/lego/1-Varia/Adder/adder.html">http://www.mapageweb.umontreal.ca/cousined/lego/1-Varia/Adder/adder.html</a>  and
    run into a problem.

    </p>

    <p>I''ve checked many times and I believe I have it built properly.  When I apply
    power to motor A (the A+B motor), the robot moves fairly straight backward and
    forward (minus inaccuracies introduced by friction and weight imbalance).  But
    when I apply power to motor B (the A-B motor), the robot won''t turn.  If I lift
    the robot off the floor, the wheels turn and they turn in a manner you would expect
    (one turns clockwise while the other turns counter-clockwise).  It appears the
    motor is turning against a very large load if the robot is placed on solid ground.

    </p>

    <p>I can''t figure out why....

    </p>

    <p>I also looked at the one at <a href="/wiki/adder_subtractor_drive">Adder Subtractor Drive</a>
    and I don''t see much difference there.

    </p>

    <p>I''ve spent quite some time on this and to be honest, I am very disappointed
    with the adder-subtractor configuration.  I have a hard time to balance things
    out to make the robot move forward truly straight.  On top of that, the lateral
    drag is really bad.  It can only work on a very smooth surface - and only after
    I added a worm-gear assembly to do the driving.

    </p>

    <p>I tried using a pivot and that helps with the turning but the robot would have
    a much harder time moving forward straight.

    </p>

    <p>I don''t have access to a set of balloon wheels.  You''d mentioned that one
    can construct a holonomic wheel - using standard Mindstorms parts?

    </p>

    <p>If all else fails, I am thinking of using the adder-subtractor assembly only
    for moving forward-backward, and using the other motor to turn a front wheel like
    the ones they use with tri-cycle drives.

    <p>Thanks for the answer Danny.

    </p>

    <p>What you said makes sense.   I do have a long rectangular construction (I placed
    the RCX flat behind the gear rather then vertical like you did) and so may be
    that''s why it''s dragging.  I wonder if it would work if the wheels pivots.

    </p>

    <p>Regarding the doubling, I was going to try a 1-to-2 split of the A-B motor
    so that it can gang up with the A+B motor when it needs to drive straight.  But
    I need to resolve the dragging problem first.

    <p>Hi Legofan,

    </p>

    <p>Actually, what you are seeing is what I would expect. The motor A should be
    straight forward or back, and if you actually set motor B to brake (not float),
    then the drive itself should iron out some of the weight imbalance, although veer
    due to friction (or slip) cant be helped by the drive, and I use six wheels with
    fat tyres to try and deal with that. Motor A is always the forward/reverse motor.
    Now motor B is a bit different.

    <br/>If you consider the outputs L and R, then (and this might be the other way
    around depending on your design), output L is A + B, and output R is A - B. This
    means that when you brake motor A, and power motor B, the wheels are expected
    to turn in opposite directions.

    </p>

    <p>Now one problem I have encountered with any <a href="Skid+Steering"
    title="Skid Steering">Skid Steering</a> robot is that of wheel drag - you may
    want to look at how close together the sides are, and how long the vehicle is.
    If it is too long and thing, the wheels will be creating lateral (sideways to
    their running) friction - which is what may make it appear to be struggling against
    a heavy load on a high friction surface. At this point, you need one of two things
    - to change the robots geometry so the wheels are closer to a square than a rectangle,
    or to use <a href="Holonomic+Wheels" title="Holonomic Wheels">holonomic
    wheels</a>, which cannot be bought from Lego, but can be constructed with a bit
    of ingenuity.

    </p>

    <p>One thing I have been looking at at the moment is a nice way to double up the
    A and B inputs to the system. My solution has been to use another diff on each
    input, feeding two motors into a diff, and taking the diff output as an input
    into the <a href="Adder+Subtractor+Drive" title="Adder
    Subtractor Drive">adder subtractor</a> inputs. This will compensate for the fact
    that in a normal skid steer bot, two motors are hauling the load and in this it
    is down to one to struggle along.

    </p>

    <p>Anyway, I hope this helps you out Legofan,

    </p>

    <p>Danny
