    <p>Well according to one fellow on <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="Lugnet" title="Lego
    Users Group Network">Lugnet</a> - a Pick A Brick (PaB) store in Oberhausen, Germany
    has the balls at 0.50 Euros each. This is not really great if you are looking to buy
    a whole cart-load though.

    </p>

    <p>I would still recommend <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="Bricklink" title="Lego
    Trading Commnity">bricklink</a>. Maybe if enough people get together they could
    email <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="Lego" title="The best known construction
    toy">Lego</a> and get them to sell bulk ball packs. Remember that the Basket Balls
    are the same dimensions as the footballs, and having a good mix of them means
    that you will have a more interesting looking machine.

    </p>

    <p>This also leaves the potential of being able to use a light-sensor to try and
    separate them.

    <p>&gt; There is, I''ve heard tell, some PaB (not in the States, but UK IMS) that

    <br/>had

    <br/>&gt; soccer balls for bulk sale. I know you can get a lot of soccer balls
    in a

    <br/>&gt;PaB cup (a small cup here in the States holds about 180 - I don''t have

    <br/>enough

    <br/>&gt;(yet!) to tell how many a large PaB cup holds, but it looks to be around

    <br/>300).

    </p>

    <p>Does anyone in the UK know if any of them have the balls? Do Hamleys still

    <br/>have a PaB section? This requires a bit of investigation..

    </p>

    <p>I have just ordered a bunch from bricklink - but I get the feeling it is

    <br/>not going to be enough.
