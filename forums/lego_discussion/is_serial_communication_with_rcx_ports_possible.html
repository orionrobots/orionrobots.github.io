    <p>It may be possible to create a <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="Serial+Data+Stream"
    title="Serial Data Stream">Serial</a> link between the <a class="wiki wiki_page"
    href="Lego+RCX" title="The Lego RCX">Lego RCX</a> and the <a class="wiki wiki_page"
    href="Lego" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> CyberMaster using
    a sensor port on the <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="Lego+RCX" title="The Lego
    RCX">RCX</a> and one sensors port and one motor port on the CyberMaster. It may
    also be possible between two <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="Lego+RCX" title="The
    Lego RCX">RCX''s</a>.

    </p>

    <p>The <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="Lego+RCX" title="The Lego RCX">RCX</a>
    sensor port is capable of sampling(sensing) and in active mode can produce a signal(go
    in and out of active mode - creating mode changes).  Now I am not sure that the
    Cybermaster can do the same - it may mean you have to use a Motor port for output,
    and a sensor port for input.

    </p>

    <p>Why would you do this? Firstly - if you have a CyberMaster and <a class="wiki
    wiki_page" href="Lego+RCX" title="The Lego RCX">RCX</a>, you can free up the limitations
    of <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="IR" title="Acronym for Infra Red">IR</a>, and
    use a <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="Wireless" title="Wireless">wireless</a>
    communication system with the CyberMaster to control the bots(although you will
    not be able to upload programs to the RCX in this way).  Secondly - it means you
    can get the two systems to work together for a bot with more sensors, and more
    motors, as well as double the processing ability. Using <a class="wiki wiki_page"
    href="IR" title="Acronym for Infra Red">IR</a> communications between two <a class="wiki
    wiki_page" href="Lego+RCX" title="The Lego RCX">RCX''s</a> is fairly limited -
    and also requires line-of-sight.

    </p>

    <p>The <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="CyberMaster" title="CyberMaster">CyberMasters</a>
    motor port will be outputting <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="PWM" title="Pulse
    Width Modulation">PWM</a> - which is a fairly course signal, and makes it not
    suitable for serial output . A <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="PWM" title="Pulse
    Width Modulation">PWM</a> device even on full power does not output a straight
    line signal.

    </p>

    <p>Does anyone have any ideas or experience with this?

    <p>I have spotted, on <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="Lugnet" title="Lego Users
    Group Network">Lugnet</a> a group who are selling an I2C communication board which
    sits in front of an RCX''s IR ports. It is sold with a few additional boards for
    items like servo''s etc.

    </p>

    <p><a class="wiki external" href="http://orionrobots.co.uk/tiki-directory_redirect.php?siteId=136"
    rel="external">Mindsensors</a> also have many other very cool RCX add ons.
