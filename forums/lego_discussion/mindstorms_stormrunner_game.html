    <p>Has anybody here actually played through the <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="Lego"
    title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="MindStorms"
    title="A Robotic construction toy system from Lego">Mindstorms</a> game "StormRunner"?

    </p>

    <p>It is an interesting and amusing game, which teaches and strengthens the use
    of programming to get a robot to acheive things. Anyway - I have been playing
    it for a while and have a few questions for any other players.

    </p>

    <p>For a start - I need to let Lego know that the Satellite link (which you get
    when you search the CESS Galapogos) does not work.

    </p>

    <p>Secondly- once you have found other RCXs which dont seem to work, you can click
    on them, and it says they cannot initialise. Is there any way you can equip them
    and take command of them? I tried to use the piledriver to shift them - and it
    does not do anything.

    </p>

    <p>Does anyone actually know what the piledriver is for? I have not managed to
    sucessfully use it for anything.

    </p>

    <p>If this game was brushed up, made into a full desktop game, I would probably
    buy it.

    </p>

    <p>A couple of ideas for a furthar version of the game:

    </p>

    <ul><li> A minimap - god knows how much that would help

    </li><li> To have the full <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="Lego+RCX" title="The
    Lego RCX">Lego RCX</a> code system at your command - while including the primitives
    for controlling the buggies and their extensions kind of built in.

    </li><li> Maybe for the game to be a bit bigger - like a bit of base building
    to allow research into more buggy extensions, and production of buggies - so you
    could expand the sensors and add weapons or otherwise.

    </li><li> A 3D System allowign for different camera angles.

    </li></ul><p>

    <br/>Again - if a game based on this started off with a scenario not unlike stormrunner,
    then developed into a full on Real Time Strategy (RTS) game based on <a class="wiki
    wiki_page" href="Lego+RCX" title="The Lego RCX">RCX</a> programming - it would
    be a seriously nice game - and I would not be alone in paying good money to buy
    it and play it. The best thing is - the current stormrunner game could be used
    as an intro and promotion for it.

    <p>&gt; Hey, is there anywhere that we can still play this game? I miss it...
    <img alt="mrgreen" src="img/smiles/icon_mrgreen.gif"/>

    <br/>Not sure - we probably should petition Lego, and <a class="wiki external"
    href="http://www.templar.com/info/games_stormrunner.html" rel="external">Templar
    Studios</a> (the studio who produced the game) to do another one.

    </p>

    <p>I would love to see a more seriously featured desktop game - I have been entertaining
    the idea of creating a game similar to this that develops into an RTS with programmable/customizable
    units, which of course have a development time and cost.

    <p>well iv played the game and beat it and now just having fun with it such as
    a army of rcx''s and I bet I could try to make my own version of the new game
    but im not good with graphics and would probably do some riping from the game
    but I wouldn''t be able to do a good nxt but I will try but would like your submissions
    at <a class="convert-mailto" data-encode-domain="gmail.com" data-encode-name="gameguy.garrett"
    href="mailto:nospam@example.com">gameguy.garrett at gmail.com</a> also I am also
    a fan of base building games so that I could do easily but I might face a loading
    problem also the base building would problem be done as a upgrade interface.

    </p>

    <p>also has any body have a program for auto searching for the rcx for energy
    and metal? also if you have what all sensors are you using?

    <p>&gt; I wonder why Stormrunner never got exceedingly popular. It shoulda.

    </p>

    <p>Well maybe it should have with the robotics community, but it was pretty niche.
    I suppose programming robots is not everyones idea of a game. Plus there were
    a few major flaws in the programming system, and maybe bringing a relatively complete
    desktop version, with a more full bodied programming system would help.

    </p>

    <p>If it used NXT code, and had an constructopedia to build models that would
    work with the code, then the finished programs (using a light sensor instead of
    heat and other similar substitutions) could be downloaded to a real NXT. Maybe,
    a stormrunner <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="NXT" title="Legos NeXT generation
    robotics kit">NXT</a> extension pack, with a real heat sensor, the game software,
    and some additional Lego parts, in the mould of the Mars Exploration addon pack
    for the <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="RCX" title="The Lego Robot Command Explorer">RCX</a>,
    would be a really cool idea.

    </p>

    <p>This would give them the opportunity to do spybotics style missions, have some
    nice video sequences, still have the strategy/exploration game internally (maybe
    linking up with some real world set ups) and also have some nice ideas for models
    - like ones that can roam, and pickup cans or other such items, stashing them
    into a hold.

    <p>&gt; It would be really great if Lego create Stormrunner continouation.

    <br/>&gt; For example it could be Stormrunner 2 where story is the satelite signal
    from satelite that was gathered from CESS Galapagos, was heared on Earth and Earth
    has send an rescue team to find what happened to the June Castle, Clark Winter
    and rest of the crews.

    <br/>&gt; What do you think?

    </p>

    <p>I think that would be a great idea, especially if the new game used the <a
    class="wiki wiki_page" href="NXT" title="Legos NeXT generation robotics kit">NXT</a>
    (and promoted it), with its sonar unit and bluetooth to acheive somethings the
    <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="RCX" title="The Lego Robot Command Explorer">RCX</a>
    couldnt. Maybe having the NXT and the RCX could allow for comparison, where you
    get the RCX early on, but get an NXT a little later in the game. Of course, to
    do this, the programming system may have to resemble robolab instead of RCX code,
    but that is not necessarily a bad thing.

    </p>

    <p>Again- if it was a desktop game, I would buy it.

    <p>To get to the energy sensor:

    </p>

    <p>Applied method: distraction

    </p>

    <p>Build a Hermes and an Achilles-class, equip the Hermes(I did it with the Achilles,
    but the Hermes is faster..., both work) with a grabber-arm. Nothing more.

    </p>

    <p>Get both in the Tormod. Then position the Achilles so that it will drive from
    the right to the left underneath the eater so it gets eaten. "BUT WAIT" first
    you must position the Hermes in the top left corner facing down so all you have
    to do is make it move forward one square, turn right, pick the thing up(don''t
    store), turn right again, move into the safe zone.

    </p>

    <p>First you activate the Achilles, the moment the plant moves to eat it you activate
    the Hermes. Now you should have The Energy sensor.

    </p>

    <p>Here are its stats:

    </p>

    <p>P:3

    <br/>E:2

    <br/>L:2

    <br/>weight:0.05

    </p>

    <p>Have fun.

    <br/>&gt; I have not had that trouble with the black squares on the datalogs.
    Although trying to play this week has left it loading only in the "Unsupported
    Browser" mode even on IE. Which is a pain - because I cannot access my save games.

    <br/>&gt;

    <br/>&gt; I did actually post to Lugnet''s dear Lego section about this - but
    have not heard anything back.

    <br/>&gt;

    <br/>&gt; So far my best way around the plants is to drive past them without stopping
    so they dont get a chance to eat you. I cant see any other way. piledriving them
    does not injure them - and be really careful even manouvreing in their path. To
    get an item at a distance from a plant, you may need to build a sacrificial RCX
    - once they have eaten, they take a while to eat again - this might gain you the
    temperature sensor - although I have not found it yet myself.

    <br/>&gt;

    <br/>&gt; You would have to program up both RCX''s and get them started on the
    path fairly close to one another. Make sure the program gets each one in, gets
    the item and gets out. There is a danger however that the plant takes the wrong
    bait, and gets the RCX with the sensor after it is grabbed- that would be a disaster.

    <br/>&gt;

    <br/>&gt; I am going to have to find the heat sensor - once I can get the save
    games working again.

    </p>

    <p>Go about 5 squares West and straight South and you''ll find the Tormod. It''s
    in there. You have to have a security level of 2 to get in...Clark leaves a copy
    of it in his first datalog.

    </p>

    <p>"Thanks for that Anon- but I mean the little web-page link that loads when
    you click the satellite in the Galapogos to try and store it in the launcher.
    I get the horrible feeling that Lego have stopped maintaining the game for sometime
    - and it is falling apart. Sad really - a very promising game. Maybe a posting
    for Lugnets "Dear Lego" is in order..."

    </p>

    <p>I didn''t notice there even was one. It''s been a while since I did that. What
    I did notice was that all of the little piles of rocks that have a datalog on
    them are black squares until you remove the datalog. It might be Firefox, but
    I doubt it. I tried to load it in IE, but my Microsoft VM became corrupted or
    something.

    </p>

    <p>On a side note, what ARE those piles? I think they''re little house things..who
    knows. Is there a way to find out about what happened to the other crews, and
    is there any way to get around those stupid plants that eat the RCX''s?

    <br/>&gt;

    <br/>&gt; You must go to the top left corner of the map with an RCX on the Arachne

    stand in the middle of the weird orange thing. Run the "launch" code. There ya

    <br/>&gt; One RCX is lower on the map and you myst come up behind it, stop, then

    on the center right of the map. You need to use the piledriver on it three times
    to break it free.
