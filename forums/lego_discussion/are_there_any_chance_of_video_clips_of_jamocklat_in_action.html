    <p>That big blue mecha you created is wonderful - a true masterpeice of a

    <br/>Lego creation. I am sure I am not alone in asking if there are going to be

    <br/>some video clips of it in action. For those of us unable to make it to

    <br/>brickfest - seeing it do some of the stuff it looks capable of would be

    <br/>great.

    </p>

    <p>Cheers,

    <br/>Danny
