    <p>Radio Shack manufactured this new VEX Robotics kit. When I first read about
    it from the Popular Science magazine, it was stated as a much better than LEGO
    MINDSTORMS.  So, I got online and read the specification.  Well, it is really
    NOT better than mindstorms, especially in educational value department.  Wonder
    if there is anyone out in this galaxy has had experience with the Vex and provide
    me a bit more insight.

    </p>

    <p>Thanks in advance!

    <p>Hi Elizabeth,

    <br/>There have been recent discussions regarding this on <a class="wiki wiki_page"
    href="Lugnet" title="Lego Users Group Network">Lugnet</a>, specifically comparing
    it with the <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="RCX" title="The Lego Robot Command
    Explorer">RCX</a>.

    </p>

    <p><a class="wiki external" href="http://news.lugnet.com/robotics/?n=24096" rel="external">http://news.lugnet.com/robotics/?n=24096</a>
    - I note that you have been posting on this.

    </p>

    <p>It is not better in terms of educational material, but in terms of usefulness
    once you have experience, it is much better. It has more IO ports, and also opens
    up possibilities of real <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="Serial+Data+Stream" title="Serial
    Data Stream">serial</a> communication.

    </p>

    <p>I cant say I am not a huge fan of the Erector/Mechanno when compared with <a
    class="wiki wiki_page" href="Lego" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a>
    is has its uses as a <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="Construction+Toy" title="Construction
    Toy">Construction Toy</a> and the two can actually be interfaced.

    </p>

    <p>All in all though, the kit comes with <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="Servo+Motor"
    title="A motor with built in positioning control - easily interfaced with digital
    systems">Servos</a> and rotational motors (which appear to be modified servo''s)
    which are a great deal more useful than the <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="Lego"
    title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> motors. Unless you are an evangelical
    Lego user (which I am definately not), there is no greta problem in using these
    together. With a good servo - you alleviate the need (in some cases) for a rotation
    sensor.

    </p>

    <p>So if you are buying for Educational Value, choose the RIS or <a class="wiki
    wiki_page" href="DACTA" title="DACTA">Dacta</a>, if you are buying for raw power
    in terms of processing, interfacing, remote control and flexibility - buy the
    VEX. Myself.  I am intending to purchase the VEX, and use both in my workshops.

    </p>

    <p>As far as I am concerned - you can never have enough variety in MicroControllers.  I
    am yet to find one that fits <strong>all</strong> my needs in the different bots
    and challenges we get.

  content: "\n<p>Hello everyone.\n</p>\n<p>I have built several sophisticated Vex\
    \ robots so far, in addition to many LEGO Mindstorms robots. At this point, I\
    \ will agree 100% with Popular Science in saying that <strong>Vex is better than\
    \ Mindstorms</strong>. I own several Mindstorms kits, plus one Vex kit. I have\
    \ been involved with a half dozen Lego Mindstorms competitions and three Vex competitions.\
    \ Ever since I bought my Vex kit, I have never touched my Mindstorms kits.\n</p>\n\
    <p>With Vex, you can run up to eight motors or servos, as compared to just three\
    \ with the RCX. You have 16 analog/digital input/output ports to use. Vex currently\
    \ has six sensors (Ultrasonic, Shaft Encoders, Line Following, Light Sensor, Limit\
    \ Switch, Bumper Switch), although any digital or analog sensor can be used. I\
    \ have used custom IR short and long range sensors and potentiameters on my Vex\
    \ robots.\n</p>\n<p>The eight motor ports generate PWM signals, so any PWM device\
    \ can be plugged into these. This includes regualar servos or <a class=\"wiki\

    \ the Educational <a class=\"wiki external\" href=\"http://www.usfirst.org\" rel=\"\
    external\">FIRST</a> Robotics competition, which involved LEGO Mindstorms, Vex\
    \ Robotics, and full-size robots, I can say that LEGO Mindstorms are best suited\
    \ students aged 9-14. <strong>The Vex Robotics kit, with a much greater sophistication,\
    \ blows away the Mindstorms kits for students aged 14+</strong>. The Vex kits\
    \ are way better at teaching programming, engineering, mechanical design, and\
    \ robot competitions than the LEGO Mindstorms kits.\n</p>\n<p>Here are some pictures\
    \ of my current VEX robot, which scores 'tetras' and is a complete 1:3 scale replica\

    <p>Is VEX coming to an end?

    </p>

    <p>It appears that Radio Shack are now selling off all their old stocks, and are
    discontinuing the VEX line, at least according to sources on the DPRG.

    </p>

    <p>I am not sure why they have decided to do this, but if you want ot purchase
    VEX kit - now is the time to buy it at discount if you want it.

    </p>

    <p>Is it possible that they are completing this line to prepare for a next generation
    to rival the Lego NXT?

    <p>Okay - a question to those who are in the know  - where in the Uk could I acquire
    a VEX Robotics kit, better still at the low prices they have on the RadioShack
    home page.

    </p>

    <p>Radio Shack dont actually appear to ship outside the US.

    <p>Orion,

    <br/>I''m in the U.S. I just picked up two Vex starter kits.  My local radioshack
    had them listed for $99.00each! also stocked up on the sensors and tread accessories.
    They only had two starter sets but will be searching for the sonar kits this weekend.
    A friend bought another after checking out the java-vex website, they gave it
    very high remarks and it seems like there is a lot you can do with the controller.
    They only had two but will be searching for the sonar kits this weekend. I would
    be willing to pick up another and ship it if you''re still looking.  Not sure
    what shipping would be but 1/3 the retail the  price can''t be beat!

    </p>

    <p>Chris, I like that idea a lot. If you could quote me using the web contact
    forms (ie off the public section) with a quote, and email details or something,
    then we can sort it out from there. If it works out at about the right price,
    I would be prepared to pay for postage to you, and then to the Uk, as well as
    adding in a little for the service. Please get in touch using the <a class="wiki
    external" href="http://orionrobots.co.uk/tiki-contact.php" rel="external">Contact
    Us</a> part of the site.

    <p>Hi there, I have just noticed that the Vex line (starter kit and accessories)
    does not seem to have any worm gears, or differentials. Has anyone managed to
    find or get advanced drive mechanisms working with VEX?

    </p>

    <p>An example would be the <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="Adder+Subtractor+Drive"
    title="Adder Subtractor Drive">adder subtractor drive</a>.
