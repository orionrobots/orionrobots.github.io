    <p>Well we hit a milestone last night in OrionRobots site history. We have now
    officially past One Million Page views, and these last few days have been more
    busy than ever.

    <br/><img alt="biggrin" src="img/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"/>

    <br/>Tonight, I will be putting aside my <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="Lego"
    title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> and <a class="wiki wiki_page"
    href="Oscilloscope" title="Systems designed to view voltage/current over time">Oscilloscope</a>
    and celebrating. Not too long though, I will be adding a tiki-mod for technorati
    tags (so other tiki sites can use it), as well as continually, as always, updating
    and maintaining the content of this site.

    <br/>Well done OR readers!

    <br/>Orion
