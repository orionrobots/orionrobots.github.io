    <p>At the moment, only those with editor priviledges are allowed to modify the
    wiki. If you are learning the markup, I suggest you use the preview feature. We
    have had to disable the sandbox following a number of incidents of severe abuse.

    </p>

    <p>Please bear in mind, this is a site aimed at children and adults, and therefore
    carries an ICRA rating for its content. Any person posting what amounts to abuse
    will have their account suspended.  Please ensure you have read out <a class="wiki
    wiki_page" href="Terms+And+Conditions" title="\terms_and_conditions.html">Terms And
    Conditions</a> before posting to OrionRobots.

    </p>

    <p>To become an editor, you must either be attending a regular meeting and be
    known to me personally, or have posted comments and to forums constructively for
    a number of months, I may grant it, or you can request to become an editor when
    I am sufficiently satisfied that you will be a benefit to this robotics community.

    </p>

    <p>Regards

    <br/>Orion
