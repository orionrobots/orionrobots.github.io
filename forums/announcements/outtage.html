    <p>This week, OrionRobots.co.uk experienced an outtage due to a networking issue
    at the hosting company. I would like to apolowgise or any inconvenience that may
    have caused.

    </p>

    <p>Since that point - there seems to be some odd behaviour on some firefox browsers
    that results in the page being fully loaded, but the loading "throbber" does not
    stop. I assure you that all the content is fully loaded, and that we are looking
    into the problem, though at this point I am not entirely sure why it is occuring.

    </p>

    <p>If you see it, and have any idea why it might be happening, please let me know.

    </p>

    <p>I have also stored some of the  references to images stored on other sites
    for the flags on the bottom of the page - this should reduce the dependancies,
    and hopefully speed up loading.

    </p>

    <p>Regards,

    <br/>Danny Staple
