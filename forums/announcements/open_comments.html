    - this is work in progress. However, since I am informed of all changes, any abuse
    will result in:

    </p>

    <ul><li> Comments are removed

    </li><li> Responsible Users (and all their related work) will be removed

    </li><li> IP Addresses will be barred

    </li><li> In extreme cases - details will be handed to the authorities.

    </li></ul><p>

    <br/>Please ensure you have read our <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="/wiki/terms_and_conditions.html"
