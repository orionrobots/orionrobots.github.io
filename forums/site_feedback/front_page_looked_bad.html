    <p>I spotted a mistake on my websites rendering when viewing it in a browser with
    smaller metrics (something I should do more often).

    <br/>I noticed that on the front page, the side bar was pushed right out, obscuring
    the Login box. If you spot something like this, or browser incompatibilities,
    please let me know!

    </p>

    <p>I will say that the site is best viewed in Firefox - my primary browser, although
    it has been tested in Mozilla, Opera, IE and even Interactor.

    </p>

    <p>I have now tested on 1028x768 and 1280x1024. I dont think it renders very well
    in 640x480. I am interested to hear the findings of Lynx users.

    <p>&gt; Colin, the latest update should have fixed this properly. Hopefully it
    will not break anything. I am still testing it.

    </p>

    <p>Okay the new site issues are now fixed. The Google Ads are now in better places,
    the login is at the top. I ma looking for any other feedback people have about
    it now the upgrades are live.

    <p>Hi Colin,

    <br/>I am trying to keep the google ads above the fold line - but I suspect the
    Login box might be good on the Left, and the search, and online users tools on
    the right where the box is now.

    </p>

    <p>When you are logged in - your posts (in theory) should go through, with tout
    the moderation process. The process was put in place because I ended up with lots
    of poker game people flyblogging - and had to close up the access to the forums
    a little.

    </p>

    <p>The long moderation times are currently down to when I check each of the forums
    - the problem being that the current version of TikiWiki - the CMS I am using,
    does not email or notify me when there are queued messages, and the only way to
    approve them is to check each individual forum - it s a bore, and when I have
    a moment - I may look to finding a way to get the PHP to mail me...

    <br/>Cheers,

    <br/>Orion

    </p>

    <p>I think you should put your login about the google ads.... pushed to the bottom
    corner of the page it''s missed.

    </p>

    <p>suppose XFM Featherweight Challenge I should register... would it reduce the
    long moderation time lags?

    </p>

    <p>regards,

    <br/>colin
