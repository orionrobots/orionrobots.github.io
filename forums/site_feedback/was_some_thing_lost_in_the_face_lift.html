    <br/>Hi Colin,

    <br/>It could well have been- the main reason for the face lift was actually a
    major upgrade to the CMS software, which required major style sheet changes, so
    the face lift came with it. I''ll see if I can find the post in the backup DB
    from then - as it was on a DB about 3/4 days older than the main site. I''d had
    a lot of spam comments appearing on the site in various places - otherwise I''d
    have ignored the updates, and also taken a newer DB copy.

    <br/>Sorry about that.

    </p>

    <p>Danny
