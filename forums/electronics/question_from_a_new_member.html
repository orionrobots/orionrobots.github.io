    <p>A recently registered user messaged me with a question, which we thought might
    be better placed on the forums, along with my responses.

    </p>

    <div class="simplebox">

    <p>Hello

    <br/>Thanks for accepting my registration.

    <br/>I enjoyed your site very much as my main interest is in robotics.

    <br/>I am an electronics technician, and have been teaching myself C++ and Assembly
    so that I can program my robot with code for various tasks.

    </p>

    </div>

    <p>

    <br/>Given the small memory footprint, C may be worth learning, but if you are
    after something that makes more sense to an electronics engineer, you may find
    the <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="OOPic" title="OOPic">ooPIC</a> worth a look,
    especially the "virtual circuits" concept it uses. Plus as it comes with objects
    designed to control servo''s, and on the boards plugs designed to accept them,
    as well as dealing with <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="PWM" title="Pulse Width
    Modulation">PWM</a>, <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="I2C" title="Inter Integrated
    Circuit bus">I2C</a> and a myriad of interfacing systems, it may be a tad easier
    than trying to roll your own all the way.

    </p>

    <div class="simplebox">

    <p>As I have surplus Z80 CPUs and 2764 EPROMS, I have been trying to design a
    microcontroller using these components, instead of using dedicated microcontrollers,
    such as PIC and others.

    </p>

    </div>

    <p>

    <br/>This shouldnt be a problem, but you will have to consider what you might
    need to add systems in for IO. You are not going to want to simply wire motors,
    sensors etc directly into the bus, and probably want some sort of chip just to
    give you the ports. There are however, chips in the Z80 family which work as single
    chip microcontrollers<a class="wiki wikinew" href="tiki-editpage.php?page=microcontrollers"
    title="Create page: microcontrollers">?</a> with the digital<a class="wiki wikinew"
    href="tiki-editpage.php?page=digital" title="Create page: digital">?</a> and analogue<a
    class="wiki wikinew" href="tiki-editpage.php?page=analogue" title="Create page:
    analogue">?</a> IO on board. You would also have to program things like <a class="wiki
    wiki_page" href="PWM" title="Pulse Width Modulation">PWM</a> control for motors/servos,
    but you may find that there is library code online to help you there.

    </p>

    <div class="simplebox">

    <p>I have found it quite a challenge to learn assemly, and although learning the
    rudimentaries, it is another thing to apply this knowledge to programming an EPROM
    and writing code for these components.

    <br/>Do you think I may be better off investing in applying my efforts to using
    a PIC or other microcontoller?

    </p>

    </div>

    <p>

    <br/>Okay - I would say to learn what you are comfortable with. Having a surplus
    of a particular component can be a good reason to put it to use, but what you
    may find, if the particular die and layout of Z80''s you have do not actually
    have the IO, that you end up adding in an MCU anyway.  Maybe you could take a
    look here: <a class="wiki external" href="http://www.z80.info/" rel="external">http://www.z80.info/</a>

    </p>

    <div class="simplebox">

    <p>I enjoy learning programming, and as an electonics technician, the physical
    construction will be relatively easier than writing code and programming the 2764
    EPROM.

    <br/>My ultimate goal is to construct an underwater robot for exploration.

    </p>

    </div>

    <p>

    <br/>Ah - I have had some fun myself doing underwater bots, the linkages can get
    quite interesting.

    </p>

    <div class="simplebox">

    <p>Once again, do you think a PIC will be a lot easier for robot control?

    </p>

    </div>

    <p>

    <br/>I think the ooPIC would be by far the easiest device, but even a PIC will
    probably be significantly easier to interface with than a basic Z80.

    </p>

    <div class="simplebox">

    <p>Is using a Z80 and 2764 overkill for robot control?

    <br/>I''d appreciate your feedback. Thanks

    <br/>ozwired

    </p>

    </div>

    <p>Overkill is not really the correct word, its more just design for purpose.
    Z80 is a more general purpose processor, which has embedded applications but does
    not AFAIK come with built in''s designed for robotics and similar control engineering
    projects. However, I think there may be some Z80 based packages which do have
    those things. Exactly which do you have in your surplus?
