    <p>I want to use a Pneumatic (not Hydraulic) system in a lifting application.
    If the internal circumfrence and full extent (capacity) of a cylinder is given,
    how could I calculate the pressure needed to lift a given weight?

    </p>

    <p>How would I best go about controlling such a device so I could program it to
    lift items to a certain height and then stop lifting - given that the height may
    not be the maximum extent of said cylinder?

    </p>

    <p>Thanks

    </p>

    <p>Good question. Now I will get back to you on the calculations, but the program
    is an interesting one.

    </p>

    <p>Assuming you are using some kind of Micro Controller,
    you could use a sensor to detect the position of the lifting arm - either a rotation
    sensor (if your arm is a jointed kind) or a distance sensor if the arm moves in
    a linear/parallel way (like a fork lift).

    </p>

    <p>You would then monitor this sensor, and use the feedback from this to control
    the <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="Solenoid" title="Solenoid">solenoid</a> assuming
    you are using solenoids. If the cylinder is double acting - this feedback can
    be used to manouvre the arm into the right position.

    </p>

    <p>I imagine there are variable pressure valves for fine manouvering, although
    they may be expensive and difficult to find. However - I have been working on
    building one of these (at Lego scales - but could be scaled up) with commonly
    available parts - and will eventually be selling these through ebay and the site.
