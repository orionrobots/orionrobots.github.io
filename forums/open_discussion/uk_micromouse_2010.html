    <p>UK MICROMOUSE 2010

    <br/>Saturday June 26th

    <br/>Millennium Point

    <br/>Birmingham B4 7XG.

    </p>

    <p><a href="http://www.tic.ac.uk/micromouse/">http://www.tic.ac.uk/micromouse/</a>

    </p>

    <p>It''s a great event, worth the trip. I''m hoping to encourage the biggest turnout
    of minisumo, there''s quite a number out there!

    </p>

    <p>best regards,

    <br/>Colin

    <br/>It was good the year I managed to get to one. I just went a bit spam busting
    as I realise this thread had been spammed - its clean now...

    <p>I forgot to add you can find more info on this minisumo on this <a class="wiki
    external" href="http://www.minisumo.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=482"
    rel="external">forum post</a> and <a class="wiki external" href="http://www.minisumo.org.uk/wiki/index.php?page=AnotherFormulaMiniSumo"
    rel="external">wiki page</a>, the write up isn''t complete but it''s getting there.

    </p>

    <p>The aim of <a class="wiki external" href="http://www.minisumo.org.uk/wiki/index.php?page=FormulaMiniSumo"
    rel="external">formula minisumo</a> is budget entry into the competition... while
    not precluding competition with non-formula minisumo it leads to an opportunity
    to compete on a more level field like "Formula Ford" in motor racing. In this
    case it''s fixed motor/gearbox, motor driver and battery voltage.

    </p>
