    <p>My Female Android Robot Project Update.

    </p>

    <p>Hello everyone.

    </p>

    <p>As you know there are a few female android prototypes in the market  or seen
    at the convention show.

    <br/>However, the androids are very simple because they can''t walk, and some
    are simply pre-recorded voice

    <br/>or very simple AI.

    </p>

    <p>I want to be the first to make an advance android female robot that can walk
    with AI that can interact with people

    <br/>and the surrounding.

    </p>

    <p>If it works GREAT, and if it does NOT work ...life goes on with a large credit
    card debt.

    </p>

    <p>Short form spec for the android.

    </p>

    <p>Pro:

    </p>

    <p>Project Name: Project Aiko

    <br/>Code Name: Aiko

    <br/>Height: 153 cm

    <br/>Weight: still adding more hardware

    <br/>camera: 3 cameras with 3ccd

    <br/>battery: MN-polymer

    <br/>Mainboard: C7 with 8Gig solid state.

    <br/>Sensors: 12 sensors (max 16)

    <br/>DOF: 30

    <br/>Software: Sandai (advance version)

    </p>

    <p>Con:

    <br/>Sandai can Not handle center of gravity when wearing shoes.

    <br/>CPU and memory intensive

    <br/>Must connect to the internet to get data from our server.

    <br/>(Can run without connecting to our server, but action are limited)

    </p>

    <p>Aiko body was custom made from implant silicone from head to toe, therefore,
    it looks and feels as close as a female human.

    <br/>The body is now being re-done and re-designed in Japan with our new specification
    to make it looks more female like with a slimmer body and lighter weight.

    </p>

    <p>I am hoping to have a demo video sometimes this week.

    <br/>In the mean time, I have upload the pictures.

    </p>

    <p>

    <br/>

    <br/>

    <br/>I put the picture behind the black background, because I thought it looks
    better.

    <br/>p.s. If you have any suggestions, please post it here or email or PM me.

    </p>

    <p>Thank

    </p>

    <p>For video demostration see below

    <p>Aibot - thank you very much for your information. This is certianly an interested
    project, and you are welcome to keep us posted on orionrobots.

    <br/>This is certainly a fantastic robot, and looks very realistic. All the demos
    are impressive, although the math one is by far the most interesting.

    </p>

    <p>I also would like to inspire you further, and say that if it does not work,
    you would have learned so much on the way, that it would bring you closer to sucess
    next time, as well as a big debt. These kind of pioneering projects are invaluable.

    </p>

    <p>I find it interesting that you have used ALICE and AIML todo this. For a natural
    language interface, it is very much head and shoulders above similar systems.

    </p>

    <p>One thing I noted, which may be down to the way the video was shot, is that
    the servo noise seems to slightly drown out the speech a little, and it may be
    necessary to increase the volume to compensate for that. While it is fantastic,
    I am hoping to see the less disembodied videos that you mention with the body.

    </p>

    <p>Keep up the good work, and please let us know when you have more news on the
    project. One question, once you build this, and it begins to do what you would
    like it to, what markets do you see for it? I can probably see hospitality as
    the key one for her.

    </p>

    <p>Danny
