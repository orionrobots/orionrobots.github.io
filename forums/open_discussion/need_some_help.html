    <p>I am basically looking for any one who can help answer a few questions on building
    robots...

    </p>

    <p>I really need to get a rough estimate in price of how much it would cost to
    build a life size robot. Is it achievable? Can many people in the UK build them
    and do universities have the resources and technology to produce these robots.

    </p>

    <p>Any help guys would be very well appreciated.

    </p>

    </p>

    <p>I don''t really follow this type of robot built but it''s been the topic of
    discussion form time to time on robotbuilder.co.uk

    </p>

    <p>There seemed to be some good projects coming from a chap called James Bruton
    who can be found here <a href="http://www.xrobots.co.uk">www.xrobots.co.uk</a>

    </p>

    <p>I hope this give some good inspiration!

    </p>

    <p>regard,

    <br/>Hi There Vincent,

    </p>

    <p>This is one of those "How long is a piece of string" kind of questions. How
    much do you want to spend? What functionality do you want, how many movement areas
    (Degrees of Freedom? How many and what kind of sensors will you need?

    </p>

    <p>How much computational power (onboard or outboard) would you want to throw
    at it? How much time to research a system like <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="Horse+And+Rider"
    title="One system takes high-level control of a lower level system">horse and
    rider</a>, <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="BEAM" title="Biology, Electronics,
    Aesthetics and Mechanics">BEAM</a> or Subsumption architecture? What tools do
    you have - for example a PCB etch lab and plastic vacuum former?

    </p>

    <p>When you say "life size", I presume you mean a human like android. These can
    be pretty expensive, as you will require many high-torque servo''s, probably ones
    with feedback to the actual CPU. For projects like that, look up Open PINO<a class="wiki
    wikinew" href="tiki-editpage.php?page=Open+PINO" title="Create page: Open PINO">?</a>
    and <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="Cog" title="A robotic model of human form
    and behaviour">COG</a>. Pino has full plans for building a human like robot platform
    for experimentation.

    </p>

    <p>I would probably put aside a basic budget of between 1 and 5 thousand pounds
    to start it off.

    </p>

    <p>Regards,

    <br/>Danny

    </p>
