    <p>Hi there Colin,

    <br/>I was there this weekend, I am yet to write up all the interviews now I have
    posted the pictures. The pictures need captions as well.

    </p>

    <p>Cheers,

    <br/>Danny

    <p>&gt; Hi, nice to see you at the show.

    <br/>&gt;

    <br/>&gt; Did you by any chance get any video of my Rover ... Rovering around?

    <br/>&gt;

    <br/>&gt; Thanks

    </p>

    <p>Hi there,

    </p>

    <p>I did not get any video, but I did get a few photos. I am still working on
    writing up the show, but in the meantime I will get the photos into a gallery.
    Video footage of it following the ball would have been good - I will have to get
    a better camera for video for the next show - my phone is really not quite up
    to the job.

    </p>

    <p>Cheers,

    <br/>Danny

    <p>Hi Danny,

    </p>

    <p>&gt; We will be there as spectators. I hope to see you there - I will be

    <br/>&gt; interested in meeting up.

    </p>

    <p>I should be there all day, I trust you''ll find me by my robots... it''s always
    good to talk and swap ideas. It''s the best reason to attend events even if your
    not running a robot (or it''s not quite up to scratch).

    </p>

    <p>I look forward to meeting you!

    </p>

    <p>best regards,

    <br/>colin
