    <p>Hi Guys

    <br/>TekTime Radio recently interviewed Mark Tilden, and I thought you guys might
    be interested in listening to the interview.

    <br/>It is long 40 minutes but will worth the listen.

    <br/>He is an inspirational character and a fantastic orator.

    <br/>Here is a direct link to the mp3 file.
