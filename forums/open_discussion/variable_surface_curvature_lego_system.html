    <p>Imagine being able to make variable surface curvatures such as  spheres, tubes,
    torus/doughnuts, terraced planes and dish structures etc out of only two simple
    components. One component is a flat hexagonal plate and the other is a flat square
    plate

    <br/>The novelty is, is that the hexagonal plates have hinges on all six edges
    whilst the squares only need hinges on their two opposed edges. The two parts
    can click into one another allowing them to hinge.

    <br/>Basically you make a flexible space matrix by joining, two parallel planes
    of hexagons together, in a particular manner, using the vertically orientated
    squares as the walls.

    <br/>The hex plates would have lego buttons moulded into their surface area. Upon
    completion of this matrix, the modeller is then free to build upon it.

    <br/>By the addition of clickability into the hinge design one can build a surface
    area which could be incrementally morphed from one curvature into another.

    </p>

    <p>The question is-would you welcome such a concept??

    <p>I''d suggest a couple of places.

    <br/>First - the search "Lego Dimensions", shows many images with various aspects
    for them - handy to know. I''ve used it plenty of times, and because different
    images have different ones, you''ll need to combine a few to get the bits you
    want (Lego actually has a number of attachment systems - stud/hole, pin/hole,
    round/clip (inner stud) and so on.

    </p>

    <p>The Second thing is too look at "Bitbeam" - a gridbeam clone made with Lego
    studless construction in mind  - Bitbeam is a version of grid beam - open source
    construction modular stuff, made with simple laser cut wood, designed to interoperate
    with Lego stud less beam construction styles. <a href="http://bitbeam.org/">http://bitbeam.org/</a>

    </p>

    <p>Finally - there will be nothing more accurate than grabbing a couple of Lego
    pins (both friction and smooth), some Lego beams and using a digital calliper
    to take your own measurements. You may need to make a few mock up bits to get
    the stuff fitting together nicely.

    <p>Aloha Orion, I thank you for your advice with regard to pin joints being more
    suitable for this application. I am trying to find without success the Lego specifications
    for a pin joint hole. Can you help?

    <br/>This is exciting as I have linked up with a cadcam company who are busy prototyping.
    </p>

    <p>&gt; Also in my experience with Lego, studs are useful for some connections
    (the more aesthetic kind), however pin based constructions make for much stronger
    structures build to deal with complicated mechanisms. The use of pins and beams
    allows Lego to be used for structures not unlike Meccano ones, albeit out of plastic
    and without needing to tighten bolts.

    </p>

  content: "<p>Aloha Orion,</p><p>It's been a long while since I last visited.\
    \ Last week I gave Lego my best shot and am somewhat disappointed by their recent\
    \ response.</p><p>\"Dear Bob,</p><p>Thank you for your interest in LEGO\xAE\
    \ brand toys.  We are always delighted to hear from a loyal LEGO enthusiast.\n\
    </p><p>I think your lattice system using square plates and hexagonal plates\
    \ that interconnect with each other by incorporated snap hinges would make a brilliant\
    \ design concept for LEGO, but for legal reasons we can't use it! I'm sorry for\
    \ any disappointment this may cause you. We have a team of experts in Denmark\
    \ whose job it is to dream up new LEGO sets, themes and toys. They tell me it\
    \ actually takes years to plan everything. They need to test all the new ideas,\
    \ talk to the factory about how to make them, work out what sort of box is needed\
    \ and then deliver the new sets to all the shops in 130 countries! This means\
    \ that there's a good chance they're already working on something similar to your\
    \ idea.</p><p>I have however viewed and passed the link on to our product\
    \ developers for them to take a look at. It is really neat!\"</p><p>I'm very\
    \ happy to say that a further inventive application has been realised.<br/>One\
    \ side of Hexaflex has half the number of hexagonal tiles than its other side.\n\
    <br/>Using three square tiles for each hexagon tile, it is possible to make both\
    \ sides equal by adding the missing hexagonal tiles into the existing lattice.\
    \  The action of doing so converts this latticework design into a new pantographic-type\
    \ mechanism which is controllable by changing the distance between these now newly\
    \ opposed hexagons. Individual cells of the lattice can be independently opened\
    \ or closed. This opens up the possibility to make robotic snakes that move realistically\
    \ in a reticulating fashion.<br/>A picture is worth a 1000 words</p><p><tt>\

    </p><p>It's not too difficult to have these plastic injection moulded but the\
    \ stud on lego's spec's are probably patented. There's bound to be a way round\
    \ this.<br/>I have a full U.S patent that covers, amongst others. toy applications\
    \ on this, so privacy is not a problem.</p>"

    <p>Lego have, through their interaction on the design of the NXT shown that they
    are at times open to external ideas.

    </p>

    <p>My question about rigid structures, is that from the images I could see, the
    system looks very flexible. Where I would like to model more curved or at least
    many sided polygons I would need a rigid structure.

    </p>

    <p>Also in my experience with Lego, studs are useful for some connections (the
    more aesthetic kind), however pin based constructions make for much stronger structures
    build to deal with complicated mechanisms. The use of pins and beams allows Lego
    to be used for structures not unlike Meccano ones, albeit out of plastic and without
    needing to tighten bolts.

    <p>As yet this is just an idea but I do have working prototypes that  prove the
    concept.

    </p>

    <p><tt> Were you able to connect to my blogspot?</tt>

    </p>

    <p><tt> I like the idea of a more rigid connection pin rather than a stud.</tt>

    </p>

    <p>Can you rephrase your question about rigid curved surfaces. I didn''t quite
    understand.

    </p>

    <p>I''m looking for a designer who has cadcam skills to help bring this to fruition.

    <br/>Do you think Lego would help?

    <br/>I believe they don''t accept  external ideas. I''d love to be proved wrong.

    <p>&gt; It sounds great. Do you have a link? Pictures? Place to buy it?

    <br/>&gt; Please tell us more.

    <br/>&gt;

    <br/>&gt; One other thing, flexible structures are useful, but the system also
    be used to mould rigid curved surfaces too?

    <br/>&gt;

    <br/>&gt; Also, given the way technic Lego is progressing, and stud pins exist,
    perhaps it would be more useful to consider having Lego pin holes instead of studs/lugs.
    Pins can be used for more rigid connections and also the pin holes could be used
    to send axles through - ie contain the gubbins inside and have axles going through
    surfaces to effectors.

    </p>

    <p>Still getting used to this procedure....not sure if I am replying in the correct
    place....however I''ll press ahead.

    <br/>Thanx Orion for the fast reply. Were you able to read my blogspot?
