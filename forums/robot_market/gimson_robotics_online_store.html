    <p>Thanks for that.

    <br/>I think most interesting are the <a href="http://www.gimsonrobotics.co.uk/shop_dc-electric-motors.html">Gear Motors</a> 
    which are based on cordless drill motors, so have been designed for battery powered torque applications.

    <br/>They also compare rather favourably with using modified servos for price
    and simplicity.

    </p>
    <p>Cheers,
    <br/>Orion
