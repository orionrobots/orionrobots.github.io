    <p>Thanks for that.

    <br/>I think most interesting are the <a class="wiki external" href="http://www.gimsonrobotics.com/shop_dc-electric-motors.html"
    rel="external">Gear Motors</a> which are based on cordless drill motors, so have
    been designed for battery powered torque applications.

    <br/>They also compare rather favourably with using modified servos for price
    and simplicity.

    <p>Cheers,

    <br/>Orion
