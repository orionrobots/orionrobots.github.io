    <p>The East Finchley Robotics Group would like any North London based robot builders
    to attend our group. We would like to form teams for:

    </p>

    <ul><li> Robot Wars

    </li><li> Technogames

    </li><li> First Lego League

    </li><li> Robocup

    </li><li> Our own challenges and competitions

    </li><li> Any other robot competitions

    </li></ul><p>

    <br/>We also hold regular meetings of robot builders, and beleive by pooling resources
    - we can have greater robot design and building facilities for all - from software,
    to tools to materials, as well as being able to draw on the talents and experiences
    of a group of builders. We are interested in <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="/wiki/robosapien"
    title="RoboSapien">Robosapien</a> or <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="/wiki/aibo" title="The
    SONY Robot Dog">Aibo</a> hackers, <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="/wiki/lego" title="The
    best known construction toy">Lego</a> Builders and <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="/wiki/lego_rcx"
    title="The Lego RCX">RCX</a> people, kit builders, scratch builders, BEAM Robots builders, <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="/wiki/salvage_tips" title="Tips
    on pulling stuff apart to build robots. How, where and what.">junk</a> builders
    and any other building methods.

    </p>

    <p>If you are interested - please visit the <a class="wiki external" href="http://orionrobots.co.uk/tiki-view_faq.php?faqId=1"
    rel="external">Group Meetings FAQ</a> or leave a message here and we will try

    \ at Northolt - West London. We are still establishing venue etc - but we are\

    \ built a robot before, or fairly experienced - let us know your interest.\n</p>\n\
    <p>As we are needing a venue and more equipment, we are going to be charging a\
    \ small sub of \xC3\u201A\xC2\xA31 per session. The venue will be determined by\
    \ the interest.\n</p>\n<p>Plus those who come early will get involved in building\
    \ and testing the \"pyramid challenge\". Not going to tell you any more than that\
    \ until you come though! &#128526;\n\
