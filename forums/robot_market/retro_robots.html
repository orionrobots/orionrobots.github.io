    <br/>Thanks for that henry. I am placing it in the robot market. When I have a
    moment, I will look at the site and if appropriate, place it in our directory.

    <p>Retro Robot toys are sometimes quite interesting, but I admit I would always
    rather spend my money on one of the programmable robot kits (like the maplin ones).
    Half the fun of those things is the build itself...
