  content: "\n<p>Hi there - 2005 will see Extreme Fighting Machines (XFM) taking to\
    \ the road with events across the UK throughout the year.  We already have 5 events\
    \ planned this year ranging from full combat shows through to educational robot\
    \ camps for kids to experience what its like to be a roboteer.  Hopefully they\
    \ too will get the roboteering bug ! Also, in response to feedback from the public\
    \ ALL our announced main show event tickets are just \xC3\u201A\xC2\xA35 each\
    \ making them affordable for all to enjoy !\n</p>\n<p>Roboteering has been moving\
    \ forward with teams investing in new machines, and new teams appearing all the\
    \ time with better and better machines, if you've not seen what's been going on,\
    \ now's your chance !\n</p>\n<p><strong>Main Show Events listing for 2005</strong>\

    \ brings the fun and excitement that <a class=\"wiki wiki_page\" href=\"/wiki/robot_wars.html\"\
    \ title=\"The british robot smashing TV series.\">Robot Wars</a> brought to our\
    \ TV screens.  In a brand new purpose built arena, complete with new arena effects\
    \ and hazards as well as fantastic sound and light support these shows are about\
    \ showing combat robots in their element.  We've already got some top class teams\
