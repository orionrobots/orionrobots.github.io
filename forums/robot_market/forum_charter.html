    <p>Those who are regular readers will know this was called robot classifieds -
    although it lacked classification. <img alt="rolleyes" src="/img/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif"/>

    </p>

    <p>Anyway - pointers on this forum:

    <br/>You can use this section to advertise goods you want to sell/give away, items
    you want (wanted), clubs, websites and other items which I deem relevant - I am
    fairly relaxed about it - but all posts are queued and moderated.

    </p>

    <p>Rules:

    </p>

    <ul><li> I will allow thing related to sci-fi, electronic gadgets, computer books/goods
    etc - in fact virtually anything relatively geeky, but here is not the place for
    romantic novels. Items that are completely inappropriate will be rejected.

    </li><li> Any abusive, explicit or illegal goods will result in a member being
    deleted, or their IP address banned from using the website - and in some cases
    may be reported to the authorities.

    </li><li> No scripts, no gambling sites. Posts may contain a link to a website
    or ebay auction - but excessive links will be rejected.

    </li><li> No flooding - posting long descriptive posts is fine, but not repetitions
    of the same line over and over, or a non-human readable list of keywords.

    </li><li> Do not repost an item already posted. If you have advertised an item,
    and wish to highlight it again a few weeks later - post a comment to the thread
    - you will get the best out of this if you use that as an opportunity to expand
    on the information as well as advertise.

    </li><li> If you are a regular wiki user - I encourage you to markup wiki links
    to pages on the site - for example if you are talking about the <a class="wiki
    wiki_page" href="RCX" title="The Lego Robot Command Explorer">RCX</a> - then link
    with ((RCX)).

    </li><li> Please obfuscate emails with something like NOSPAM in the address. Spam
    harvesters to come over to this site and spider it.

    </li><li> I recommend that you do not leave a personal phone number or address
    - this might be okay once you have established contact or a sale, but it is not
    safe to have it on the net with no protection.

    </li><li> Children under 18 will need parental consent to participate on this
    forum. I will not take kindly to Irate parents whose kids sell their expensive
    <a class="wiki wiki_page" href="Lego" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a>
    for a fiver. I will however act with moderation - and may reject ads which look
    like they are silly.

    </li></ul><p>

    <br/>Make the purpose of your ad clear with the subject. Include if the item is
    offered, wanted, club or other, the item itself, and the location.

    </p>

    <div class="simplebox">

    <p>WANTED: Robot Books, London, Uk

    <br/>OFFERED: Free Assorted Motors, London, Uk

    <br/>EBAY: Robosapien, Leeds, Uk

    </p>

    <br/>Thanks,

    <br/>Orion
