## Running serve and build in docker


### Recommended: Using Docker Compose

Build the site:
```bash
docker compose up dist
```

Serve the site locally:
```bash
docker compose up serve
```

Get a bash prompt in the container:
```bash
docker compose run --interactive serve bash
```

**Note:** `node_modules` are managed inside the container. You do not need to run `npm install` on your host.

## Preparing to contribute

This project uses the following tools for development:

- Docker compose to run the development environment
- pre-commit to run checks before committing changes
    - You will need to install pre-commit on your local machine with pip/pipx in a python environment.

You should create a named branch for your changes, before committing, as using PR's to contribute is preferred.

```bash
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

## Running locally

You may need to determine dependencies - the docker method is preferred. Direct `npm` usage on the host is discouraged to avoid version mismatches.

## If you make changes to htaccess

For an experience closer to hosting, use docker compose:

```bash
docker compose up web
