## Running serve and build in docker


### Recommended: Using Docker Compose

Build the dist and serve:
```bash
docker compose up --build --remove-orphans
```

Get a bash prompt in the serve container:
```bash
docker compose run shell
```

**Note:** `node_modules` are managed inside the container. You do not need to run `npm install` on your host.

### Link Checking

The project includes integrated link checking to detect broken links, with a focus on images:

```bash
# Run link checker locally
./.github/scripts/local_linkcheck.sh
```

For more details, see [.github/linkchecker/README.md](.github/linkchecker/README.md).

**GitHub Actions Integration:**
- Nightly automated link checks on production
- PR-based link checks when labeled with `link-check`
- Detailed HTML reports with categorized results

## Preparing to contribute

This project uses the following tools for development:

- Docker compose to run the development environment
- pre-commit to run checks before committing changes
    - You will need to install pre-commit on your local machine with pip/pipx in a python environment.

You should create a named branch for your changes, before committing, as using PR's to contribute is preferred.

```bash
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

## Current project structure

Note - the goal is to arrive at a better structure, that is a work in progress.

- .github/ -> github workflows, linter configurations, utility scripts (including desk ones - not ideal)
- _data -> json file for eleventy data
- _drafts -> WIP posts, old content that should be completed, or pulled and should be on another blog. It has some utility scripts and tools that should not be here.
- _image_sources -> SVG files, high resolution images before processing, XMP or image process data files. Should not be uploaded to the site. Candidate for LFS.
- _includes -> liquid include files carried from jekyll into 11ty. They are still very much in use - templates, layouts, render components and utilities.
- _posts -> json data for the list of blog posts. Might be redundant, the state of that json file needs checking and moving/removal if it's not in use.
- admin -> netlify admin tools, intended for an easy way to add/edit posts without being directly in github. Not currently working, but has worked before.
- assets -> a mixutre of style assets (logos and tools), downloadable file assets, and images for posts or wiki pages. Ideally - it should only be the style assets with the other parts in galleries.
- content -> Currently all blog posts, wiki and pages are here, with some exceptions. Eventaully, all site rendered markdown and images should be in this structure and not the root folder.
- error_pages -> Landing pages for 404's and similar
- galleries -> Where pictures to be served on the site, and files for downloads should be. Should be under the content folder.
- navigation and indexes -> archive, rss feeds, sitemap pages. Should also be under content. Has site build js which should be in the src folder?
- products -> content for the old shop. Still in some wiki page references, and device specifications - which should go to the wiki. Anything relating to price, shipping should be removed. This folder should be removed.
- src -> Eleventy etensions in JS, scss style stuff. All used in site generation
- / - config scripts for eleventy, tools, linters, readmes. Dockerfiles for serving, some utility tools. It has the main content index and favicon, which should not be there.

## Running locally

You may need to determine dependencies - the docker method is preferred. Direct `npm` usage on the host is discouraged to avoid version mismatches.

## If you make changes to htaccess

For an experience closer to hosting, use docker compose:

```bash
docker compose up web
[+] Running 1/0
â ¿ Container orionrobotsgithubio-web-1 Created       0.0s
Attaching to orionrobotsgithubio-web-1
orionrobotsgithubio-web-1  | ruby 3.1.1p18 (2022-02-18 revision 53f5fc4236) [x86_64-linux-musl]
```

## Staging Test Environment

The staging test environment is located in `.github/scripts/staging/` and contains Docker configuration files used for testing the built site before deployment. This environment:

- Tests the site with Apache configuration that mirrors the hosting environment
- Validates that htaccess rules work correctly
- Ensures the site serves properly before deployment

The staging tests run automatically in CI/CD workflows when changes are pushed to the master branch or in pull requests.
