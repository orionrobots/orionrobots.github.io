    <p>I think by far the best uk group for robotics discussion is <a href="http://www.robotbuilder.co.uk">www.robotbuilder.co.uk</a>
    certainly the one I use most and what seems a good spread of technical contributors.

    </p>

    <p>The picaxe forum is great for topics relating to the low cost controller itself
    and some general solutions arising from use of controllers.

    </p>

    <p><a href="http://www.electro-tech-online.com">www.electro-tech-online.com</a>
    (UK based) has a robotics chat forum and some interesting posts from time to time

    </p>

    <p>comp.robotics.misc is good but answers tend to have a USA based answer (especially
    when you''re looking for components) and uk.tech.robotics just tends to be _very_
    quiet

    </p>

    <p>regards,

    <br/>colin

    <p><a href="//orionrobots.co.uk">orionrobots.co.uk</a> is intended
    to cover a broad audience - including
    <br/>complete beginners. Depending on where you are based, you may be able to
    <br/>attend our Saturday classes - which are mindstorms based for kids in the
    <br/>morning, and less so for the adults in the afternoons. We are based in
    <br/>London.
    </p>
    <p>Another suggestion is the DPRG list, and also comp.robotics.misc might be
    <br/>worth checking out.
    </p>
    <p>Anyway - if you have a question that is non mindstorms, feel free to ask
    <br/>it at the forums on Orionrobots.

    <br/>&gt; Just looking for lists that might be either less mindstorms centric
    <br/>&gt; but more active in beginner robotics building/programming.

    <br/>&gt; Thanks.
