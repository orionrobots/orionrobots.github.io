    <p>Hi everybody,

    </p>

    <p>I am investigating the validity of a foreign patent that describes toy which
    chases a spot of light projected on the ground by a handheld controller (e.g.
    flashlight or laser pointer).

    </p>

    <p>It is very similar behavior to a classic Photovore but is distinguished by
    the fact that the photodetectors are aimed such that they ignore the source of
    the light and only see the reflected spot.

    </p>

    <p>I have heard of people doing this with the Mindstorms kits, but does anyone
    have objective evidence - preferably dated printed or published material -  of
    such a device existing earlier than 2002, either a commercially available product
    or something someone cobbled together? I would very much appreciate any help you
    can provide me in tracking this down; it''s really important to me to find a prior
    art example.

    </p>

    <p>Thanks in advance,

    </p>

    <p>Stephen

    <br/>&gt; I am investigating the validity of a foreign patent that describes toy

    <br/>&gt; which chases a spot of light projected on the ground by a handheld

    <br/>&gt; controller (e.g. flashlight or laser pointer).

    </p>

    <p>What''s the problem with the patent? depending on where it''s registered it''ll
    have limited value! US patent doesn''t apply else where in the world... hence
    multiple applications. It doesn''t have the same international agreements that copyright
    has.

    </p>

    <p>I''m certain that you''ll find reference in may books and web articles that
    predate 2002. However there may be some thing novel in the application...

    </p>

    <p>regards,

    <p>&gt; Hi everybody,

    <br/>Hi Stephen

    </p>

    <p>&gt; I am investigating the validity of a foreign patent that describes toy
    which chases a spot of light projected on the ground by a handheld controller
    (e.g. flashlight or laser pointer).

    </p>

    <p>That sounds like it should fall foul on the clause about something being reasonably
    obvious.

    </p>

    <p>&gt; It is very similar behavior to a classic Photovore but is distinguished
    by the fact that the photodetectors are aimed such that they ignore the source
    of the light and only see the reflected spot.

    </p>

    <p>Umm - Again - any given line follower uses a similar set up - no, it does not
    sound patentable. The whole toy may be copyrightable, but this part of it sounds
    unlikely. I am not a lawyer though.

    </p>

    <p>&gt; I have heard of people doing this with the Mindstorms kits, but does anyone
    have objective evidence - preferably dated printed or published material -  of
    such a device existing earlier than 2002, either a commercially available product
    or something someone cobbled together? I would very much appreciate any help you
    can provide me in tracking this down; it''s really important to me to find a prior
    art example.

    <p>Most definitely. If the specifics are that they are aimed at an angle, then
    I am sure examples exist in ample supply in <a class="wiki external" href="http://lugnet.com/news/robotics"
    rel="external">Lugnet.robotics</a>. The community there will definitely be very,
    very vocal on this one. I have built (although I am not sure I have more than
    just a grainy photo) robots which have a light sensor, with a techic-brick-with-holes
    positioned to narrow its focus. I then used an angled beam (known as a lift-arm
    in Lego part terms) with the sensor to get it angled downwards.

    </p>

    <p>&gt; Thanks in advance,

    </p>

    <p>You are more than welcome.

    </p>

    <p>Danny
