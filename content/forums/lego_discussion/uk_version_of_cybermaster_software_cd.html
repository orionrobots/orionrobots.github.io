    <p>Hi deburgess,

    </p>

    <p>I notice from the <a class="wiki external" href="http://news.lugnet.com/robotics/cybermaster/"
    rel="external">Lugnet Cybermaster</a> group that you have a possible source. I
    must admit I have the same issue, in that I have a German language CD. I have
    heard some people mention that Lego can be fairly helpful with these things, but
    that the UK CD''s are in very limited supply.

    </p>

    <p>Danny
