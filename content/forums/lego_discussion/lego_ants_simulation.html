    <p>I have recently been discussing building a colony of RCX or spybotics based
    ants. I am wandering what ideas people here may have.

    </p>

    <p>What I intend is to use an RCX or Spybotics control for a base station, and
    have it broadcast a simple repeating message - to say I am here. Then to dot a
    few of these at some distance from this to represent food. To keep a fairly narrow
    area for this, I will probably build a structure with this pointing downwards.

    </p>

    <p>The actual ant bots will probably be simple rovers, with a pen at the rear
    (always down) and a light sensor set up for line following at the front. We need
    to make sure that the ir transceiver is visible, and incorporate a simple bumper.
    This is well within the capabilities of a spybot (with their built in sensor)
    which are much cheaper that the RCX.

    </p>

    <p>The program will use a random number system to pick out a path, and when another
    line is encountered may choose to follow it. It will keep track of the amount
    of food (a simple decrementing register) it has, and stop if it has run out. When
    it has a lot of food - it will seek its base, otherwise it will seek more food.
    If an ant encounters one without food it can instruct the "dead" bot to follow
    it back to base and start again - where it will use stored food in the base to
    revive itself (another counter).  Back to base normally will mean to turn roughly
    180, and look for the line. If we want to be clever - we could position the pen
    so it is very close to the center of the turning circle - which would save confusion.

    </p>

    <p>The bumper behaviour could be a simple back off, and turn left or right (randomly
    determined again).

    </p>

    <p>For the pen ink, we need to try and find some ink that fades away after about
    20 minutes, and a good reflective surface.

    </p>

    <p>This experiment would result in interesting behaviour - and would be best filmed
    in controlled lighting conditions to minimise the IR interference.

    </p>

    <p>If RCX''s are used - a motor could be used to raise the pen when an ant has
    run out of food. This could be achieved with the Spybot, by having a clutch gear
    based system opposing a suspension spring. The clutch gear system, when enough
    forward motion is present, would lower the pen - so the line would be drawn, and
    when there is not enough forward motion, then the pen would be raised. This could
    simplify the "dead" behaviour - in that instead of waiting for a mate, it slows
    down, and "limps" back towards its base - still trying to follow lines. This would
    mean the errant path is not re-drawn and will fade sooner - optimizing the whole
    emergent system.

    </p>

    <p>Anyway - its up for discussion - do you have any ideas for this? I would like
    to keep it all Lego - bar the pen and surface. I am thinking of leaving it a few
    days and trying about 10-20 ants.

    <p>Another thought on this would be to add in "predator" or competing ants. This
    would complicate the simulation - but would mean having another "nest" for the
    predators/thieves - who would (using a different kind of line or  something) lay
    their own pheromone trails (the lines) which the ants cant read, read the ants
    trails, and then go and feed off of ants by going close to them, and using messages
    to increment their food count while reducing that of their victim.

    </p>

    <p>A victim would again end up limping back, and therefore there would be an emergent
    tendency (hopefully) in the ants to take a route avoiding the predators. The predators
    would probably tend to attack both the nest areas, and feeding areas of the ants.

    </p>
