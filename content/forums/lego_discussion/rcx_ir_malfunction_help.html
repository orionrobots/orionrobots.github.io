    <p>My RCX is totally non-communicative,

    </p>

    <ul><li>LEGO MINDSTORMS ROBOTICS INVENTION SYSTEM 2.0 RCX-communication failure
    cannot be solved.

    </li></ul><p>

    </p>

    <ul><li>Cannot install firmware, no communication whatsoever between the tower
    and RCX.

    </li></ul><p>

    </p>

    <ul><li>The tower seem to be operational:

    <ul><li>Settings (for example range) can be done by the control program.

    </li><li>The green led lights when operating.

    </li><li>Infrared leds operate (checked with a digital camera sensitive to infrared
    lights)

    </li></ul></li></ul><p>

    <br/>RCX works in boot mode but doesn''t receive any communication.

    </p>

    <ul><li>Tried different ranges from 3 cm to 3 m.

    </li><li>Tried with three different sets of batteries.

    </li><li>Checked battery (6xAA) voltage: &gt;1,5 V each.

    </li><li>Checked with two different computers (the other is Win98)

    </li><li>Installed "XP upgrade"

    </li><li>All other IR sources blocked, tried inside a small cardboard box also.
    Windows blocked (sun light)

    </li><li>All permanent "test programs" 1-5 seem to work OK.

    </li><li>Four times uninstalled and re-installed all software and hardware.

    </li><li>All XP updates installed.

    </li><li>All other devices working correctly.

    </li><li>Tried different USB ports in my PC.

    </li><li>No physical damage in RCX. It''s brand new, purchased just one week ago.

    </li><li>RCX 2.0 Serial number = 625521

    </li></ul><p>

    <br/>The RCX IR communication port seem to be totally inoperative, most probably
    due to some component failure. This is of course possible (at least 1/10000) even
    though the general quality of LEGO products seem to be high.

    </p>

    <p>Ideas?

    </p>

    <p>Do you know how to get hardware serviced?

    </p>

    <p>The dealer <a href="www.buyandbehappy.de" rel="">www.buyandbehappy.de</a> cannot
    help and doesn''t accept the kit as return because naturally it''s opened and
    a LEGO.

    <p>&gt; I had the same problem with my USB IR tower until a few days ago. The
    problem is caused by Hyper-Threading capabilities of your processor. There is
    a special driver you need to install from the LEGO Mindstorms Webpage.

    <br/>&gt;

    <br/>&gt; Here is the Webpage:

    <br/>&gt; <a class="wiki external" href="http://www.lego.com/eng/service/faqs.asp?section=ConsumerService-FAQ-TechSupport&amp;tech=true&amp;catid=87BC4CA6-D8CD-4BF1-8307-6B52AB45AF02"
    rel="external">Lego Tech Support - HyperThreading Driver</a>

    </p>

    <p>Nice - thank you for that mindstormer. Another alternative that is not as neat,
    is to get hold of and try a serial IR Tower.

    </p>

    <p>Bricklink might be the place to look for those.

    <p>Okay - do you know anybody who has the Serial Based Tower? It is worth a try,
    although from what you say - it sounds like the RCX IR receiver may be at fault.
    The thing is, it depends on weather the tower must do a successful handshake with
    the RCX to start it responding.

    </p>

    <p>I cant say I recall the exact details of the communication protocol, but I
    would suspect no IR activity from the RCX until it has successfully picked something
    up - it would not make any sense to fire signals from the IR LED on the device
    until it has a reason to.

    </p>

    <p>It is worth contacting your local Lego group representatives. <a href="Lego" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> are normally
    fairly helpful with these things, and may be able to service it for you. I doubt
    any else can, although if you post to <a href="Lugnet"
    title="Lego Users Group Network">Lugnet</a> Robotics, then somebody there may
    have enough experience to service it - there are people on it who have produced
    partial <a href="Lego+RCX" title="The Lego RCX">RCX</a>
    schematics.
