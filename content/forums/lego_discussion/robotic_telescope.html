    <p>I want to build a robotic model telescope like the one used by the National
    Schools Observatory.  I''d like to connect it up to an RCX box for rotation, tilt
    but not viewing through!

    </p>

    <p>Any ideas?  Its for UK National Science Week in March

    <p>After reading a little, it is worth being aware of the fact that the RCX clock
    has some significant drift, and may require some correction. Sadly - this varies
    between RCX''s.

    </p>

    <p>You are advised to set the RCX clock, and then check it around 10 hours later
    to calibrate that drift.

    </p>

    <p>I would also additionally mention that you should probably use worm gears for
    the turntables to ensure that they dont get easily knocked off course. You could
    then have a touch sensor along each of the axes triggered by a tooth of some kind
    so it could position itself in a startup position. This could also be achieved
    with two rotation sensors - but the touch sensors are much simpler and cheaper.

    </p>

    <p>Anyway - did you actually manage to build one? We would love to see it.

    <p>I would suggest using a large <a href="Lego" title="The
    best known construction toy">Lego</a> Turntable to mount it on, and building a
    technic beam frame around the telescope itself (to mount it). For elevation, I
    would suggest using two large technic gears mounted under the frame, with an axle
    connecting them to the chassis, and a motor with a fairly large gear reduction
    for both rotation and elevation.

    </p>

    <p>If you were really sneaky, you could use the RCX''s built in clock to track
    an object, or light sensors. Let us know how you go, here is a great place to
    put photos and log your build.

    </p>
