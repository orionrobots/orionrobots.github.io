    <br/>

    <br/>I guess I''ve come to the conclusion that the lego mindstorms 2.0 kit would
    be a great place to start learning about robots?  I was looking at robot hobby
    kits and build from scratch kits and they are so expensive, that I really think
    you get much more bang for the buck buying the mindstorm kit which allows you
    to not only build robots but program them as well....comments?

    <p>&gt; And  there is NQC. A great language fore programming

    </p>

    <p>Yes, I rather like <a href="NQC" title="Not Quite C
    - A Lego PBrick Programming Language">NQC</a> too, though if you want to go furthar,
    you could consider <a href="BrickOS" title="An entire Embedded
    OS for the RCX">BrickOS</a> or <a href="Lejos" title="A
    Java Based Lego RCX OS">LeJOS</a> which are C, and a Java based systems respectively.

    </p>

    <p>&gt; What to say about <a href="LDraw" title="The LDraw
    Lego CAD System">ldraw</a> with <a href="MLCad" title="MLCad">mlcad</a>?

    </p>

    <p>Its a great way to capture your models for sharing their designs, or keeping
    them for later. It is also useful if you want to go design first, and then build
    later. It is not as easy for technic based modelling as the more basic system
    <a href="Lego" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a>,
    but it is very handy, and has a good community behind it on <a
    href="Lugnet" title="Lego Users Group Network">lugnet</a>.

    </p>

    <p>I would also recommend taking a look a <a href="LeoCad"
    title="The Open Source Lego CAD System">LeoCAD</a>. <a
    href="MLCad" title="MLCad">MLCad</a> and <a href="LeoCad"
    title="The Open Source Lego CAD System">LeoCAD</a> both have their pros and cons,
    but <a href="LeoCad" title="The Open Source Lego CAD System">LeoCAD</a>
    is currently moving a lot faster than MLCad as it has the ability to be a little
    more community developed and shaped.

    </p>

    <p>The <a href="RCX" title="The Lego Robot Command Explorer">RCX</a>
    and <a href="MindStorms" title="A Robotic construction
    toy system from Lego">mindstorms</a> parts are mostly in there, and I have heard
    that the <a href="NXT" title="Legos NeXT generation robotics
    kit">NXT</a> parts are coming, but they will not be in the official parts yet.

    </p>

    <p>On a final note - before you consider buying the Mindstorms 2.0 kit, I would
    seriously wait a couple of months for the release of the <a
    href="NXT" title="Legos NeXT generation robotics kit">NXT</a> (expected august/september
    2006), which is the next generation system.

    <p>The <a href="Lego" title="The best known construction
    toy">Lego</a> <a href="MindStorms" title="A Robotic construction
    toy system from Lego">Mindstorms</a> kit is indeed a good place to start. Not
    only do you get a controller, sensors and motors. You also get a integrated development
    environment (or an <a href="IDETool" title="Integrated
    Development Environment">IDE</a> ), a whole set of peices to build your robot
    chassis with, a whole bunch of ideas and challenges to start you off and also
    the backing of the <a href="Lugnet" title="Lego Users Group
    Network">Lugnet</a> community.

    </p>

    <p>It also lays a good foundation for later, when you find the limits of the <a
    href="Lego+RCX" title="The Lego RCX">Lego RCX</a>, you
    can either purchase a second RCX (expensive), or move on to more advanced MicroControllers like the <a href="OOPic"
    title="OOPic">OOPic</a>. You could still continue to use your <a
    href="Lego" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a> for the bodywork
    and mechanics.
