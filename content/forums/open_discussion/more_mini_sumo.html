    <p>Well that was a fantastic event, not so many minisumo but the wall followers
    and maze solving was awesome!

    </p>

    <p>The venue was ace, shame I didn''t manage to get a look round the science museum
    down stairs... I''m certainly looking forward the next one.

    </p>

    <p>My performance wasn''t so great in the minisumo but at least I''ve two weeks
    to sort the problems before the next AWS event in Hull. <a href="http://www.robotwars101.org./phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=832">http://www.robotwars101.org./phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=832</a>
