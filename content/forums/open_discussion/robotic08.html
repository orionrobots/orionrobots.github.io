    <br/>My weekends are working well for this one. This is the 4th year for this
    event, as before there are no fees for entry - you can just turn up on the day!
    I''d hope that we can run a MiniSumo competition with enough people there.

    <p>I think the Holloway events are annual in April but I don''t have any details.
    Best bet is to keep an eye on the micromouse forum....

    <p>&gt; Hi Danny,

    <br/>&gt;

    <br/>&gt; You coming to this one?

    <br/>&gt;

    <br/>&gt; I liked the photos of the last event, Should be good fun again this
    time.

    <p>Hi Orac,

    </p>

    <p>I also got your PM. I enjoyed the last event, but will not be able to fund
    going to Birmingham this time sadly. I do hear that there are events in Holloway
    Road in London, so I would certainly be able to make those (I am based in London).

    </p>

    <p>Cheers,

    <br/>Danny

    <p>Thanks again for letting us know Colin. You should probably leave a link too.
    When I was there, Chloe mentioned a London event near Holloway - do you have any
    more info on that?

    </p>

    <p>Cheers
