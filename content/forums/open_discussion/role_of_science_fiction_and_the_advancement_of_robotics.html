    <p>Most people learn about robotics from science fiction books or films. Rarely
    are there news about real life robotics achievements such as ASIMO.

    </p>

    <p>How important is science fiction for the support of future robotics efforts?

    <p>Just for note - here is a link I found covering the book:

    </p>

    <p>It can still be purchased at Amazon.

    <p>Hi there Matt,

    </p>

    <p>A good question, and one I thought about a lot.

    <br/>I have an old book, one I have kept since I was a kid, it is not in great
    shape, but it allows me some inspiration. It is named "The Science in Science
    Fiction" - and it specifically studied what was technobabble and what was real,
    and which parts of sci fi could become reality any time soon.

    </p>

    <p>The one device that most reminds me of this book is owned by nearly every person
    in the developed world, and will gain a foothold in the developing world - and
    that is the mobile phone which outstripped even Star Trek technology of the time
    this book was printed, by absolutely light years (excuse my pun).

    </p>

    <p>I think you are correct that there is rarely news, but there still is news,
    and things like ASIMO and QRIO, as well as the Darpa Grand Challenge, the Rep
    Rap team (who I am yet to write more about) are all things which are early news
    which possibly predate a much larger shift.

    </p>

    <p>Things seen in sci fi may come to pass, possibly in our lifetimes, but they
    will take time, and obviously inspiration. There is little better inspiration
    than sci fi, beyond perhaps studying the natural world and how creatures have
    evolved to survive in it. Sci fi is one of the driving forces, it is the dreams
    of many people captured in an easily distributed, entertaining and digestible
    form, with potential to inspire others as it did the original authors.

    </p>

    <p>I still read Sci fi today written in the 1950''s or even earlier (HG Wells
    wrote a great deal more than The War Of The Worlds), some which has dated very
    well and is just as relevant now as it was then.

    </p>

    <p>So in summary, it is very important. Without dreams, we could never reach for
    the stars. There needs to be a balance between dreamers and doers. Engineers,
    planners and architects all have there place. If you can not imagine it, if no
    one can imagine it, it may be all but impossible to achieve something.

    </p>

    <p>Keep on dreaming, and keep on building...

    </p>

    <p>Danny
