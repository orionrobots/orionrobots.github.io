    <p>This definitely sounds interesting. Especially the <a class="wiki external"
    href="http://www.kurukshetra.org.in/events/index.php?catch" rel="external">Catch
    me if u can</a> contest. It is a shame that I am not likely to be able to make
    it to India on those days.

    </p>

    <p>Readers are welcome to discuss the exhibition here, their experiences and even
    swap ideas for any of the challenge events they have. I will probably pitch in
    and suggest ideas and answer questions.

    </p>
