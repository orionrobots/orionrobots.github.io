    <p>Hey, I''m 14 and am new to bot building, but for my first, I''m hoping to build
    a lightweight Rambot possibly adding a spinning disc at some point.

    </p>

    <p>But to the point. I need to decide on how to drive it, I understand motors
    would be more powerful and faster, but servo''s wouldn''t need a speed controller?
    I need some oppinions.

    </p>

    <p>As you can gather from my age, my budget isn''t super huge.

    <p>Hey,

    </p>

    <p>I can''t be sure yet, but i think it''ll be about 15" * 10" * 4", Is this a
    realistic size?

    </p>

    <p>And also, I think I will go down the motor route, but I feel so bogged down
    by all the choices of motors, radio modules, and esp''s,&#x1F633;
    please could you help me choose? &#x1F609;

    </p>

    <p>Hi there,

    <br/>It kind of depends on a few things. You are right basically that motors are
    more powerful, and that servo''s don''t need a speed controller or H-Bridge. Servo''s
    simply come with the speed control and bridge included.

    </p>

    <p>Servo''s modified for continuous rotation are used in smaller, lightweight
    bots, and allow an RC receiver or microcontroller PWM output to directly drive
    them.

    </p>

    <p>It is worth bearing in mind that while a speed controller adds cost and weight,
    so do servos, and all told, the cost of two servos vs two motors + a speed controller
    will not be that far different. The latter is slightly more costly, but will give
    more performance.

    </p>

    <p>What sort of scale is this robot, and what sort of weight? A rough idea is
    that the lower end (robots little bigger than RC cars) would lend itself better
    to the servos, and the higher end to the speed controllers.

    </p>

    <p>One last thing to bear in mind, is that it is possible to salvage DC motors,
    and build a H-Bridge for the motors yourself. It takes more effort, but you will
    learn all the more for doing it.

    </p>

    <p>Cheers,

    <br/>Danny

    </p>
