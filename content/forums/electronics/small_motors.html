    <p>I would recommmend going and ordering on the ''net - or as slurp suggests,
    local modelling shops. If you are using standard RC, then to be fair, there is
    nowhere better than model shops.

    <p>Depending on the scale, and the level of control you want over the speed of
    your bots, you may want to consider using modified servos directly with an RC
    without a speed controller. There are many online [Robot stores](/pages/robot-stores.html)
    that sell these now - or you can buy a standard servo, and modify it for continuous
    rotation yourself.
