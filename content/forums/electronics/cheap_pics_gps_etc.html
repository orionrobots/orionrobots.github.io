    <p><tt> Hello</tt>

    </p>

    <p>I represent a new company that sells devices of interest to the robot building
    community. We stock PIC microprocessors, Global Positioning Satellite receivers
    + much more.

    </p>

    <p>In the future we have plans to stock geared motors and wheels, mobile phone
    modules, CMOS cameras, motor controller boards, X10 modules, wireless kits and
    loads of other exciting stuff.

    </p>

    <p>Shipping is very cheap compared to the big component suppliers companies like
    Farnell + RS. It''s also fast.

    </p>

    <p>Come and have a look - <a href="http://www.coolcomponents.co.uk">http://www.coolcomponents.co.uk</a>

    <p>Hi there. Just to say that we''re about to start offering the Blue Radio BR-C30
    bluetooth radio module.

    </p>

    <p>It''ll cost about 30GPB and should allow you to control a robot from your PC
    at a distance of up to 100M via the BLuetooth radio protocol.

    </p>

    <p>There are no messy stack procedures to write, all you need to do is send and
    receive data from a serial port.

    </p>

    <ul><li>Antenna included

    </li></ul><p>

    </p>

    <ul><li>UART data interface (2-wire or 4-wire with CTS/RTS).

    </li></ul><p>

    </p>

    <ul><li>13-bit PCM, 8k samples/s, synchronous bidirectional audio interface

    </li></ul><p>Includes integrated software stack, profiles, and AT modem like commands.

    </p>

    <ul><li>Embedded Bluetooth Stack Profiles Included (requires no host MCU stack):
    SPP, DUN, LAN, PAN, Headset, Audio Gateway, FTP, GAP SDP, RFCOMM, and L2CAP protocols.

    </li></ul><p>

    <br/>The BlueRadios serial radio can be configured, commanded, and controlled
    through simple ASCII strings over the Bluetooth RF link or directly through the
    hardware serial UART. Dedicated PCM voice channel for audio applications UART
    baud rate speeds: 1200bps up to 921.6Kbps, and customized +100 meter (330 feet)
    distance

    <br/>Software adjustable transmitter power from short to long range applications
    Low power consumption (120mA TX, 40mA RX, 2mA idle mode, and 90uA deep sleep)
    Small-form factor SMT radio modem

    <br/>Self-discovery and network equipped multi-points.

    </p>

    <p>Thanks for that. We are always on the lookout for new suppliers of this kind.
    You could add yourself to the directories as well, I will approve it once I have
    taken a look.
