    <p>basically it''s a CPU and robot controller all ready to go, it has a C compiler
    for programming and can accept RC signals easily.... I was intrigued by this because,
    trying to build all that stuff from scratch, for me would seem to be a LONG ways
    away... Basically my question is what do you think of this product? Would it be
    modular and powerful enough to use in simple to advanced robot projects..and what
    about shortcomings that can be thought of?  Purchasing this and then the RC quipment
    would be quite an investment of money not to mention all the other bits like servos,
    motors, wheels, etc, so any advice would be appreciated.  I figure this might
    help me get started much quicker and then if I really turn into a robot-manic,
    I can always learn to

    <br/>work with circuit bords and all that and build one from scratch down the
    road.

    <br/>Wow, I''m still a bit overwhelmed with these controllers, not really sure
    what to make of them.... the ones you suggested, to get all the parts, they seem
    to be the same price as the one I showed you...the RC part is important because
    at times I want to control the robot inside and outside...AND I may down the road
    build a battlerobot as I have people that would like to form a team to work on
    one.

    <p>Its fairly normal that boards like these - with no soldering are used to build
    digitally controlled robots - there are very few builders who would roll their
    own pcb for that sort of thing.

    </p>

    <p>My thoughts on this are that maybe something like the <a class="wiki external"
    href="http://www.totalrobots.com/oopic.htm#oopicr" rel="external">OOPic R</a>
    or <a class="wiki external" href="http://www.totalrobots.com/brainstem.htm" rel="external">Brainstem</a>
    would be better. In the states you would probably want to shop at <a class="wiki
    external" href="http://robotstore.com" rel="external">http://robotstore.com</a>
    or <a class="wiki external" href="http://acroname.com" rel="external">http://acroname.com</a>.

    </p>

    <p>Do you consider the RC thing essential?

    <br/>At the prices you are looking at, the innovation first controller, plus the
    RC add on would be over $300. A similar set up with the others may be considerably
    more cheap and flexible. Not only that - but they have more IO ports, and more
    flexible programming systems.
