    <p>This forum is for discussing the Explorer 1 robot kit.

    </p>

    <p>There are other forums on Orionrobots for discussing other robot systems or
    general robotics, however, discussion related to using the Arduino UNO, interfacing
    with the L298 motor driver board and using the other modules in the kit will be
    accepted.

    </p>

    <p>Posts and discussions that are completely unrelated to building robots and
    robotics questions will be removed, and those posting them may be banned. Please
    keep language non-offensive, and remember that children may be reading this too.
    The list will be moderated with that in mind.

    </p>

    <p>By posting you agree that your posts may be modified to comply with this policy,
    and that they may be shown on the Orionrobots sites.

    </p>

    <p>You also agree by posting that post content may be used in Orion Explorer 1
    material to improve the product or design subsequent robot products.

    </p>
