    <p>Hmmm, try BIMBA.com, if i remember correct.

    </p>

    <p><tt>  Yeah, a little pricey, perhaps, but if you want real cylinders, they
    should have what you want.</tt>

    <br/>I found some discontinued ones from a reseller for 3.00 a pop.  Never did
    buy em, though.

    </p>

    <p><tt>  If someone can get them this cheap let me know.  I can always use a few
    new gadgets.</tt>

    <p>My advice would be to look at the <a href="FischerTechnik"
    title="FischerTechnik">Fischertechnik</a> kits.

    </p>

    <p><a href="Lego" title="The best known construction toy">Lego</a>
    have a <a href="Pneumatic" title="Use of air to operate
    and power actuators">pneumatic</a> system, but they do not include <a href="Solenoid" title="Solenoid">solenoid</a> valves. They have double
    acting cylinders (large and small), and older sets had single acting cylinders
    and two way non-return valves (on <a href="Peeron" title="Online
    database of Lego Sets and Parts">Peeron</a> as 3 way manifold). They have simple
    2 way valves - with an obscured exhaust port.

    </p>

    <p>Schools often used to use <a href="FischerTechnik" title="FischerTechnik">Fischertechnik</a>
    to teach <a href="Pneumatic" title="Use of air to operate
    and power actuators">pneumatic</a> systems - as they have double and single acting
    cylinders, solenoid valves, and also come with handy compressors - which you do
    not get with <a href="Lego" title="The best known construction
    toy">Lego</a>. They do still sell sets, and also have a robot interface of their
    own to experiment with.

    </p>

    <p>Outside of these two systems - there are parts catalogue and such, but if you
    are experimenting, or building small scale - then you will probably find other
    offerings fairly dissapointing.
