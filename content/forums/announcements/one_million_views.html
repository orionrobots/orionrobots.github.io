    <p>Well we hit a milestone last night in OrionRobots site history. We have now
    officially past One Million Page views, and these last few days have been more
    busy than ever.

    <br/>&#x1F600;

    <br/>Tonight, I will be putting aside my Lego and Oscilloscope and celebrating. Not too long though, I will be adding a tiki-mod for technorati
    tags (so other tiki sites can use it), as well as continually, as always, updating
    and maintaining the content of this site.

    <br/>Well done OR readers!

    <br/>&#128526;

    <br/>Orion

    </p>
