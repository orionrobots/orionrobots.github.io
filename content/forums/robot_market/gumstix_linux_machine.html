  content: "\n<p>I am selling some Gumstix Waysmall200ax linux machines.  The gumstix\
    \ is basically mini computer that runs linux.  All of the technical info can be\
    \ found on the company's website at <a href=\"http://gumstix.com/\"\
    >http://gumstix.com/</a>  The website will also give you a\
    \ good idea of what this thing actually is and what you can use it\n<br/>for.\n\
    </p>\n<p>It is basically the same as the Waysmall200ax listed on the website except\
    \ it has an earlier board and some modifications.   It has the BRD00002 board\
    \ installed in it and has a 20 pin header mounted to it (I will include the pin\
    \ out diagram).  I will include the power supply along with some other cables\
    \ that you can see in the pictures I posted.  The cables are: a serial cable for\
    \ connecting the unit to a PC motherboard and a power cable for drawing power\
    \ off of a motherboard.\n</p>\n<p><a class=\"wiki external\" href=\"http://pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/datadomain650/album?.dir=7dc3&amp;.src=ph&amp;store=&amp;prodid=&amp;.done=http%3a//pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/datadomain650/my_photos\"\
    \ rel=\"external\">Pictures of gumstix and accessories</a>\n</p>\n<p>I am looking\
    \ to get around $45 for each of these units, but the price\n<br/>is somewhat flexible\
    \ depending on how many you order.\n</p>\n<p>These are available for pick-up at\
    \ my office in Palo Alto or they can be shipped (you will have to pay for whatever\
    \ shipping costs, but it can\xE2\u20AC\u2122t be that much because these things\
    \ are really small).  If you have any questions about this thing, feel free to\
    \ shoot me an email.\n</p>\n<p>Please contact me by means of email at ted.sweet{NO}@{SPAM}datadomain{FORME}.com.\n\
