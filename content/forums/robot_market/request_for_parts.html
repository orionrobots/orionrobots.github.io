    <p>Hi There

    </p>

    would make them.  Please can you let me know how much each they are.  I need 8.

    <p>Hi,

    <br/>I did attempt to email you on the provided account. I can make either supply
    adaptors from PC power supplies - and I could also sell them with doctored ATX
    power supplies. However it is something I am only prepared to do a few of - and
    would strongly encourage people with the know-how to use the artical and make
    their own. It is a bit of a hack, and comes with very few guarantees - although
    a few people have built and gotten their own working based on the information
    in the artical (it is all there).

    </p>

    <p>Could you please set up an account here and use the private messaging feature
    of the site to discuss this furthar if you did not receive the email. I can then
    give you a quote on them, and make sure you are aware of the situation.

    <br/>Orion

    </p>
