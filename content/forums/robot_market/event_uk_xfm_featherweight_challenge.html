  content: "\n<p>Hi there - 2005 will see Extreme Fighting Machines (XFM) taking to\
    \ the road with events across the UK throughout the year.  We already have 5 events\
    \ planned this year ranging from full combat shows through to educational robot\
    \ camps for kids to experience what its like to be a roboteer.  Hopefully they\
    \ too will get the roboteering bug ! Also, in response to feedback from the public\
    \ ALL our announced main show event tickets are just \xC3\u201A\xC2\xA35 each\
    \ making them affordable for all to enjoy !\n</p>\n<p>Roboteering has been moving\
    \ forward with teams investing in new machines, and new teams appearing all the\
    \ time with better and better machines, if you've not seen what's been going on,\
    \ now's your chance !\n</p>\n<p><strong>Main Show Events listing for 2005</strong>\
