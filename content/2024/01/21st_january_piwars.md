We looked at pyinfra, installing services and python serial. Often debugging is not caused by a large theoretical issue but instead some small mistakes/bugs.
When there are many mistakes together, it becomes especially hard to debug. Documentation is essential to look at (as well as other people's code)!
Too many changes at once will probably arouse too many mistakes at a time; always add parts step by step.

As I am not that familiar with networking/hosts/clients, this part was more confusing to me.
