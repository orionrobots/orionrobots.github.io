Today I got the kids involved making - and we had some fun getting the motor cables the right way. However, the stall outs, or lock ups troubled me.

## Motor lock out problem

The piconzero on this (and tankbot) kept stopping - and it could even stop with the motors running.
This was disturbing.

I was researching stuff on motor stall currents, and brushing up my physics - what had I missed? The robot could fail only seconds in, or a while in.

After checking on twitter, and then reading the piconzero docs - it turns out that older pi raspbian images had i2c stability issues. So I started a dist-upgrade on it. This seemed like a great plan...

Bad news  then - I knocked out the power cable (external wall power) while doing the update!

The image I had was not going to work again. I'd luckily backed up my own code before doing so - so nothing lost but time.

And then "approx_eng", a creator of Raspberry Pi and robotics libraries, often present at piwars,  came to the rescue with an image he had with BlueZ and sixaxis control on board, along with openCV. Which will save my compiling again.

My old image used Python3 - so after using his image, there was some adapting to do.
First - `smbus` needed to be `smbus2` - but this was because I had overlooked I was in a virtual env - once I'd adapted that, the motor test worked. However, @biglesp had python3 adaptations of the piconzero code I could use now.

I got it to drive again! It was no longer hanging, but I was getting squealing motor stalls.

## Motor stalls with squealing

My next thought was to try taming it from full spin to just braking a tread at a time.
So I make a `tankTest.py` module adapted from `motorTest.py` - using the numeric keypad like tank drive controls:

| Motor   | Left | Right |
| ------- | ---- | ----- |
| Forward |   7  |   9   |
| Stop    |   4  |   6   |
| Reverse |   1  |   3   |

This was then driving brilliantly - few stalls, no piconzero cutouts. Stability seems good.

## Controller

This Raspberry PI SD card image from @approx_eng comes with BlueZ (bluetooth linux tool) preinstalled - so lets try getting the controller live.

* First - get the pad to pair/trusted in BlueControl.
* Then make a bit of code to read the pad - plan - 2 Sticks for left track/right track. Try to get button reads - start, select, 4 main buttons. Triggers later.
    * This should just print the read values.
* Adapt the tankTest to this.
* Test drive - and video.
* Publish this on orionrobots blog (filtering out real uuid's)

### Pairing

Powered up the pi - powered from PC via USB to preserve robot battery power.
Started up bluetoothctl as pi user.

Lets plug in the pad to see what happens - according to @approx_eng, this kernel and bluetoothctl has a plugin for registering the sixaxis.

I plug in and see this:

```log
[NEW] Device 00:19:C1:DE:AD:BE Sony PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller
[DEL] Device 00:19:C1:DE:AD:BE Sony PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller
```

Why is it NEW then DEL?

According to Approx_eng I should expect this:

> The guide doesn't assume you've rebuilt BlueZ from source! As I did,
> you should be able to run bluetoothctl, plug the controller in,
> say 'yes' to the prompt, then unplug and press the PS button.

Hmm - no prompt. Lets try unplug, then press the PS button.
Flashing lights on the PAD, nothing in bluetoothctl.

Do Need to be root on the Pi?
Same - NEW/DEL combo.
Nothing further from BlueToothCtl.

Time to dive into DMesg (where linux tends to keep hardware log events).

Hmm - We have the device - when plugged in. But where is the bluetooth stuff?
Need to probe more into how this image is working. The under voltage has me worried.
But first - is there a bluetooth log? Lets check /var/log as root - and see what I have:

```bash

```

Okay - start with messages and syslog. I'm using the `less` command and shift-g to get to the end of a log.

What is "mtp-probe"? Media-transfer-protocol - okay, that is irrelevant. Try syslog.

Apr  1 13:53:44 skittlebot bluetoothd[433]: sixaxis: setting up new device
Apr  1 13:53:44 skittlebot bluetoothd[433]: Authentication attempt without agent
```

Ah-hah "Authentication attempt without agent". Sixaxis is recognising the device. So what is this "authentication attempt without agent" issue?
Lets bring up bluetoothctl again.

```bash
bluetoothctl
Agent registered
[bluetooth]# agent on
Agent is already registered
```

Hmm. Lets google for that message.
Well the hits suggest I need to trust the device. Lets try that - it didn't work last night. Plug in, then do the trust.

```log
[NEW] Device 00:19:BA:DF:EE:D1 Sony PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller
[DEL] Device 00:19:BA:DF:EE:D1 Sony PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller
[bluetooth]# trust  00:19:BA:DF:EE:D1
Device 00:19:BA:DF:EE:D1 not available
```

Well why is it then not available? Lets try some more with bluetoothctl - maybe it's not properly discoverable by the sixaxis.

```bash
[bluetooth]# default-agent
Default agent request successful
[bluetooth]# discoverable on
Changing discoverable on succeeded
[CHG] Controller BE:DB:EB:6B:ED:ED Discoverable: yes
[bluetooth]# pairable on
Changing pairable on succeeded
[bluetooth]# scan on
```

And now the samsung TV - even *in standby* is flooding my console. How annoying.
Lets unplug and reattach the sixaxis.

```log
[NEW] Device 00:19:BA:DF:EE:D1 Sony PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller
Authorize service
[blue1m[agent] Authorize service 00001124-0000-1000-8000-0080deadbeef (yes/no):yes

[CHG] Device 00:19:BA:DF:EE:D1 UUIDs: 00001124-0000-1000-8000-0080deadbeef
```

That's it!
Now I may need default scripts to make this happen on startup...
Now unplug - press PS - and it is controller 1! Success.

```bash
root@skittlebot:/var/log# ls /dev/input
event0  event1  js0  mice
```

According to [The DualShock PS 3 Input Library Guide](https://approxeng.github.io/approxeng.input/api/dualshock3.html#):

> If a new device has appeared here then congratulations,
> you have successfully paired your dongle and SixAxis controller.
> This will persist across reboots, so from now on you can just connect by
pressing the PS button on the controller. Pressing and holding this button will
> shut the controller down - at the moment there’s no timeout so be sure to turn
> the controller off when you’re not going to be using it for a while.

Now lets get some python code reading it. Starting here: <https://approxeng.github.io/approxeng.input/simpleusage.html>.
I have some old code in my git repo - for doing this in pygame. But no - I think I would like to try it with this stand alone lib. I've heard good
things about the input library.
Lets start off with his sample code - understanding the parts of it.

Nice pertinent bit of information here:

> The connected property on the joystick object indicates whether the underlying device is connected or not - if, for example, you have a controller that goes out of range, runs out of batteries, or is turned off while in use this will be set to False and you can handle the case correctly (if using this code in a robot, this would be an excellent time to turn of all your motors, for instance!)

Ok some code added to read the two sticks Y position and print it.

```python
print("Left track", joystick.ly, "Right track", joystick.ry)
```

Lets run this... Ah - no module approxeng - can I pip install it?

```bash
(env3) pi@skittlebot:~/piwars-bot $ pip install approxeng.input
Collecting approxeng.input
    Downloading https://www.piwheels.org/simple/approxeng-input/approxeng.input-2.0.4-py3-none-any.whl
...
```

Oh yes...

Now output - trying the left and right sticks - but not getting what I'd expect here:

```log
Left track 0 Right track 0
[W 180401 14:32:35 __init__:295] Unknown axis code 4, value 127
[W 180401 14:32:35 __init__:295] Unknown axis code 4, value 126
```

What does this mean? Wait - 2.0.4?

Now using the controller example from <https://approxeng.github.io/approxeng.input/examples/show_controls.html> - and the axis are weird.
Time to talk on twitter.

Trying to remove "pi" from the "input" group. Then log out, back in and try again. No - nothing.
Try a reboot. Without the pad - input shows only "mice".
With it - I see 4 items:

```log
event0  event1  js0  mice
```

Show controls does nothing - sits waiting for controller. ls -l shows the story:

```bash
(env3) pi@skittlebot:~/piwars-bot $ ls -l /dev/input/
total 0
crw-rw---- 1 root input 13, 64 Apr  1 15:23 event0
crw-rw---- 1 root input 13, 65 Apr  1 15:23 event1
crw-rw---- 1 root input 13,  0 Apr  1 15:23 js0
crw-rw---- 1 root input 13, 63 Apr  1 15:22 mice
```

I spoke on twitter to the approx_eng guy. With Helena's help - and used `evtest` - which shows event sources and allpws you to look at them.

This showed nothing when not in the input group, and 2 event sources when in the group.

```bash
(env3) pi@skittlebot:~ $ evtest
No device specified, trying to scan all of /dev/input/event*
Not running as root, no devices may be available.
Available devices:
/dev/input/event0:      Sony PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller Motion Sensors
/dev/input/event1:      Sony PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller
```

* `event0` - is the motion sensing - but no buttons.
* `event1` - is the stick with it's buttons.

So my next thought was to look at how the bindings work.

## How do bindings work?

To do this - I dug in here: <https://approxeng.github.io/approxeng.input/api/selectbinder.html
>
And we wrote some code:

```python
from approxeng.input.selectbinder import bind_controller
from approxeng.input.dualshock3 import DualShock3
from approxeng.input.controllers import find_single_controller

devices, controller, p = find_single_controller(controller_class = DualShock3)

import pdb
pdb.set_trace()
```

This way we could examine the output of single controller - with a view to changing the event source.
The `set_trace` was to see it. 
This was fruitful. When it ran - I got this:

```log
(Pdb) devices
[InputDevice('/dev/input/event1'), InputDevice('/dev/input/event0')]
(Pdb) controller
Sony DualShock3 (Playstation 3) controller
```

So - can we remove event 0? Event 1 is first - which is the right device.
Lets try this to remove event0 from the list:

```python
devices = [devices[0]]
```

Lets try binding and printing;

```python
with ControllerResource(devices = devices, controller = controller) as joystick:
    while joystick.connected:
            # Do stuff with your joystick here!
            print("Left track {0:.2}   Right track {1:.2}".format(joystick.ly*1.0, joystick.ry*1.0))
    # Joystick disconnected...
    print('Connection to joystick lost')
```

This kinda works. We are getting correct values for the first stick.

## Seeing the left axis only

The second stick - r - is bound still to rT!
So - lets try the show thing again.

Well - I can see the l axis only - no buttons.
Lets try my own control class...
Tomorrow - lets pick up <https://github.com/ApproxEng/approxeng.input/blob/master/src/python/approxeng/input/dualshock3.py> and see if I can adapt it. Or see if I get a code drop from approx-eng.

## Alternative plans

Plan B Buy one of these - <https://thepihut.com/collections/raspberry-pi-gaming/products/raspberry-pi-compatible-wireless-gamepad-controller>
(or rock candy - but the dongle is soooo big)

Plan C the microbit radio hack.

Lets have a new day...

## Next stages for the PiWars robot

* Fitting camera
* Fitting distance sensors
* Getting my SkittleBot code adapted for both the driving style and new opencv.
* Making the distance sensor code.
* Tidying up - cables a mess - my plan is to use PC drive power adaptors.
* Making a cover - not sure how much time, but this is Helena's most wanted task.
