After changes to the robot hardware, a new software SD card image and lots of work on the robot, I needed to get the camera going again. It seems that the parts I'd not been paying attention to were now broken.

## Getting the camera working

* I need the picamera python library:

```bash
pip install picamera
```

* Now try my `skittletrack` code - which has had a tiny bit of python 3 adapting.
* No module gpiozero - do we really use it? No - removed.
* We then need the camera enabled:

```log
picamera.exc.PiCameraError: Camera is not enabled. Try running 'sudo raspi-config' and ensure that the camera has been enabled.
```

* Tried enabling it in raspi config. Nope. AH - it's not plugged in. Shutdown and fix that.

## After refitting and rebooting

Try again - get it running.

Yes - it works - and tracks!

We have working tracking - for random objects. Need to find HSL values for stuff, but this is a good start.

## Single distance sensor

It looks like this can be done with rpi gpio (as in Piconzero datasheet) or perhaps with gpiozero.

It was a dependency of the `skittlebot` class in the code.

## Multiple sensors

This is going to get interesting. I had a chat with @4tronix on twitter and asked for some ideas for using multiple distance sensors with the PiConZero.
The PiConZero itself wouldn't be able to, but additional GPIO boards could. So the options are:

* creating a shim to attach to sensors.
* Finding an IO extender/interceptor board.
