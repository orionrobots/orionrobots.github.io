ðŸš€ **Pre-order Alert!** ðŸ¤–  

Ready to take your robotics skills to the next level?

My new book **Learn Robotics Programming - Third Edition** is your gateway to learning AI integrations, advanced robotic algorithms and cutting-edge Raspberry Pi techniques. Learn to build low-cost robots, while gaining experience with the popular MQTT IoT protocol.

Build smart robotic behaviours that avoid walls, recognise faces and locate the robot in a space using PID algorithms, visual recognition AI models, Monte Carlo localisation, a voice recognition AI model and voice synthesis AI models. 
Learn to interface your code with motors, servo motors, Pi camera, distance sensor arrays, inertial measurement units, motor encoders and how to fuse their sensor data.

Stay tuned for more updatesâ€”exciting things are on the way!
