I'm honoured!

One of my books, "Robotics at Home with Raspberry Pi Pico", has been put into an "Embedded Intelligence" Humble Bundle. This is focused on intelligent embedded systems and bringing artificial intelligence to the edge. The bundle includes a variety of books on topics such as robotics, embedded systems, IoT, home automation, FPGA's, PLC programming and AI. It even has a book on designing your own system on a chip!

The bundle also supports Room to Read, a non-profit dedicated to ending illiteracy and promoting gender equality in education. Every purchase helps fund their mission while providing valuable learning materials.

A Humble Bundle is a collection of books, where you get to pay to get as many of the items as you feel would be useful. There are plenty of books in this bundle I would like to have on my shelf alongside my own too!
