title: Building an External Power Supply for the NXT
layout: post
---
Phillipe Hurbaine, aka Philo, another regular [Lugnet](/wiki/lugnet.html "Lego Users Group Network") robotics user has put together a replacement battery box plate which adds the capability of using an external power supply with the retail (non education) version of the [NXT](/wiki/nxt.html "Legos NeXT generation robotics kit").

The result is not quite as pretty as the original battery box. On <http://philohome.com/nxtsupply/nxtsupply.htm> he has laid out the plans, and there should be enough info to build one, and it is actually fairly simple, terminating with a standard cigar shaped DC socket. Good stuff Philo.
