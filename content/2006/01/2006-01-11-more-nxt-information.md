I have just come across a [Lego](/wiki/lego.html "The best known construction toy") Mindstorms FAQ which details a great more information about the NXT and what it will be able to do, including burning questions about using it as a USB host - which Lego say not.

<a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/mindstorms">Lego FAQ on Mindstorms NXT</a>

The device is purely a USB device, and cannot be configured as host. That is not to say that the clever community don't come up with some hack to get more out of its [USB](/wiki/usb.html "Universal Serial Bus") connector, who knows. One suggestion is a simple host board, which requests a particular file from one of its devices, and then uses that as a set of instructions to act upon.
