[Bluetooth](/wiki/bluetooth.html) is a secure [Wireless](/wiki/wireless.html) serial transmission protocol.
There are bluetooth modules that behave like a serial cable between two points, or for an endpoint you can point a smartphone at to control a robot.

A number of robot controller systems incorporate this, for example more recent Raspberry Pi devices, Raspberry Pi Pico-W and esp-32 variants.
Where not, there are add on chips/drop in systems to do this.
For robots, off the shelf bluetooth chips, like the HC-06, are available and can be interfaced with [microcontrollers](/wiki/microcontroller.html).
Keep in mind the relatively short range of such systems.

It can use a [Serial Data Stream](/wiki/serial_data_stream.html "Serial Data Stream") system and has a range of up to a few meters.
