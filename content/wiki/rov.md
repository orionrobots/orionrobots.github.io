ROV is an acronym for a Remotely Operated Vehicle.

These are arguably robots. They are not [autonomous](/wiki/autonomous.html "Autonomous"), but they do use some very sophisticated engineering and electronic techniques.

Deep sea exploration devices are more often ROVs than fully autonomous robots.

What would people say if I were to venture that [Robot Wars](/wiki/robot_wars.html "The british robot smashing TV series.") robots are nearer to [ROV](/wiki/rov.html "ROV")s than Robots?
