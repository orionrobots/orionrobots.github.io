Rack and Pinion steering is the system commonly used in most street vehicles.

The system consists of a toothed beam known as the rack, driven by a small gear known as the pinion. When the gear turns, the rack is displaced. The beam is connected in a parallelogram, with its parallel opposite fixed, and the wheels mounted on its sides.

This steering is fairly intuitive, but has a fairly limited turning circle compared with skid steering. One improvement is to have the system doubled up - so the front and rear wheels each have a rack and pinion driven by one shaft.

Its use in robotics is fairly limited - as although it allows for easy mechanical linkage to a steering wheel for a human, differential or skid steering is more easily achieved under autonomous control.

Variations are possible using simple friction assemblies instead of toothed ones.

Many RC cars use a steering system which looks a little like it - but is simply a [servo](/wiki/servo_motor.html "A motor with built in positioning control - easily interfaced with digital systems") linkage moving one bar in a parallel.
