This group is behind the [roomba](/wiki/roomba.html "A Robotic vacuum cleaning system") and My Real Baby and was founded, among others, by [Rodney Brooks](/wiki/rodney_brooks.html "Rodney Brooks") of [MIT](/wiki/mit.html "Massachusetts Institute of Technology").

The robots they produced are based on the multi-level subsumption architecture demonstrated for many years by Brooks and his team.

They are based in Massachusetts, US. Take a look at the [iRobot Website](http://www.irobot.co.uk/).
