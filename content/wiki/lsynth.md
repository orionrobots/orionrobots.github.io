LSynth is an [LDraw System](/wiki/ldraw_system.html "The primary system for CAD representation of Lego parts") [Lego](/wiki/lego.html "The best known construction toy") [CAD](/wiki/cad.html "Computer Aided Design") tool. It allows generation of flexible items - like hoses, cables, rubber bands, tank treads and similar. It has (slightly buggy) object avoidance, and with positioning of parts using standard software like [MLCad](/wiki/mlcad.html "MLCad") is quite easy to work with.

It is currently the only tool of its kind for Lego that I am aware of - and can be very handy. Take a look at my [Pneumatic Engine](/assets/downloads/PneumaticEngineLSynth.mpd) for an example. All the hoses in the image have been generated with LSynth.

The tool is available from the [LSynth Website](http://lsynth.sourceforge.net/) as well as the [LDraw System](/wiki/ldraw_system.html "The primary system for CAD representation of Lego parts") foundation.

You may note that he has an example pneumatic circuit which behaves in a similar way to mine.
