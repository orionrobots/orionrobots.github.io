A helix is a three dimensional spiral shape. Helical is the description given to something with this shape.

This is a fairly important shape in [Robotics](/wiki/robotic.html "Robotic").

It is the shape left/created in a fluid or medium by a [Propeller](/wiki/propeller.html "Propeller") blade, and the basis of the design of [Impeller](/wiki/impeller.html "A method of fluid propulsion or pumping") or [Propeller](/wiki/propeller.html "Propeller") blades.

It is also the natural shape of DNA - our [Genetic](/wiki/genetic.html "This word describes the system used by all known biological lifeforms to store sticky (permanent) or static data.") material.

[Helical Gears](/wiki/helical_gears.html "Helical Gears") are important - and offer mechanical advantages.

Screws and Bolts are essentially Helical.
