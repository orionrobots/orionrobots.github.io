These are an improvement on [PROM](/wiki/prom.html "Programmable ROM"). They allow a developer to program them (sometimes referred to as "to Blow" or "to burn") with information for use with a MicroController or [FPGA](/wiki/fpga.html "Field Programmable Gate Array") - and are then simply a [ROM](/wiki/rom.html "Read Only Memory").

However, if you wish to reprogram them, then you can expose them to [UV](/wiki/uv.html "Ultra Violet Light") to erase their contents. The chip packages usually have a small window, which can be covered with a label to protect them from accidental erasing.

These have largely been replaced by flash memory in modern designs.
