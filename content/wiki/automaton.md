An Automaton is a kind of robotic or animated toy. They tend to exhibit fairly complex and anthropomorphic (human or animal like) behaviour.

They can range from [Leonardo Da Vincis Robot](/wiki/leonardo_da_vincis_robot.html "The Humanoid Robot Designed By Leonardo Da Vinci") and Vaucanson's Duck to victorian shoeboxes (a few of which can be found in the London waxworks), where a penny would see a small and spectacular piece of mechanical theatre.

It could even be argued that more modern toys like the Tekno Robot Dog and [Furby](/wiki/furby.html "Furby") are automatons which replace intricate and complex mechanisms with [microcontrollers](/wiki/microcontroller.html).

There have been automatons to handwrite.

Al-Jazari created a handwashing automaton.

## Vaucanson's Duck

Vaucanson was a french inventor, who created an duck automaton capable of eating and appearing to digest food. It excreted too - although there may have been a concealed pouch for this.

Vaucanson also created one of the worlds first precision metal lathes using screws to adjust cutting depth for the tools, and factory machine automation for textiles.
