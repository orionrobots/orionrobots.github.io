This a drive, based on 4 omni-wheels, wheels that have 2 [Degrees Of Freedom](/wiki/degrees_of_freedom.html "A term used for the axes of movement for a robot, or robot limb."), allowing them to move in more directions than forward and back.

This allows for design of a based that can move in the X and Y directions without needing to turn, and also rotate while maintaining a straight line - giving the mobile base a full 3 degrees of freedom.

[Charmed Labs](http://www.charmedlabs.com) produce a set of these that can be used with standard [Lego](/wiki/lego.html "The best known construction toy") axles.

I am still researching into who actually developed them - I know there has been more than one attempt to patent them.
