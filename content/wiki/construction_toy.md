These are toys aimed at children yet have great value in creating robots, learning mechanical systems and engineering in general. In
fact - building real robots with these toys has become a great educational aid
for teaching physics, electronics and many other subjects.

* [Lego](/wiki/lego.html "The best known construction toy") -
[MindStorms](/wiki/mindstorms.html "A Robotic construction toy system from Lego")
* [Lego RCX](/wiki/rcx.html "The Lego RCX")
* Capsella
* Meccano - a classic construction toy using metal parts and bolts.
* [MegaBloks](/wiki/megabloks.html "A Cheaper alternative to Lego")
* K Nex
* FischerTechnik - this can be expensive, but is a very versatile system with elements that look more like industrial design than toys.

Some people can get a little evangelical about only using a single construction
toy and not using any custom parts - but for the sake of building robots - it
may be better to swap and choose.

There's an interesting idea that allows the interconnection
of K Nex and [Lego](/wiki/lego.html "The best known construction toy") called
Sploids.
