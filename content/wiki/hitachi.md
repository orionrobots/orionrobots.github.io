They are responsible for a number of [Microcontrollers](/wiki/microcontroller.html "A programmable digital controller (or ") including the one powering the [Lego RCX](/wiki/rcx.html "The Lego RCX").

They have now also surfaced as a builder of robots, as is highlighted in my [Blog Article](/2005/03/17/new-faster-wheeled-robot-from-hitachi) on there recent contribution.

Hitachi are also involved a lot with consumer washing machines, and modern ones have enough actuators, programming and sensors to qualify as real robots - even if they don't look like robots or gather as much attention as an [Android](/wiki/android.html "Android").
