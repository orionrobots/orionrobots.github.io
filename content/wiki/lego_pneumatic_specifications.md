If you are going to use Lego pneumatic parts in your design, it may be worth considering the technical specifications of some of the [Lego](/wiki/lego.html "The best known construction toy") [Pneumatic](/wiki/pneumatic.html "Use of air to operate and power actuators") parts. In most cases - this is not a worry but who knows when these figures may come in handy?

We have here SI and imperial references. Remember that these figures may vary slightly between items - and have been somewhat averaged.
