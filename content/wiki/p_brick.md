P-Brick is an acronym for a Programmable Lego Brick. [Lego](/wiki/lego.html "The best known construction toy") do a number of these:

- [SpyBotics](/wiki/spybotics.html "Lego Programmable robot kits")
- [Lego RCX](/wiki/rcx.html "The Lego RCX")
- Lego Scout
- [CyberMaster](/wiki/cybermaster.html "CyberMaster")

These are part of [Lego's](/wiki/lego.html "The best known construction toy") [Mindstorms](/wiki/mindstorms.html "A Robotic construction toy system from Lego") range. They allow a user to do robotics experiments through being able to program and interface these bricks. Most listed will work with [NQC](/wiki/nqc.html "Not Quite C - A Lego PBrick Programming Language").

It is worth noting that many of the [construction toys](/wiki/construction_toy.html "Construction Toy") are now producing these as well as [Lego](/wiki/lego.html "The best known construction toy"). FischerTechnik have a very interesting system.

The important aspects of a P-Brick are reusability, easy structural and electronic interfacing, a decent array of sensors and actuators in the system, and a progressive programming system - that is - a simple one to get kids started, and an advanced one like [NQC](/wiki/nqc.html "Not Quite C - A Lego PBrick Programming Language") for more advanced tasks.
