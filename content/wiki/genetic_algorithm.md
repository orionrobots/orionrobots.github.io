A [Genetic](/wiki/genetic.html "This word describes the system used by all known biological lifeforms to store sticky (permanent) or static data.") Algorithm is a method of design using a code, and an evolution system (survival of the fittest- gene/individual/population).

If you are interested in this area - I must highly recommend Richard Dawkins Selfish Gene.

[Distributed Hardware Evolution Project](http://www.dhep.ga/)

OrionRobots is conducting research into this area. I will put some of my more simple examples of code on the site in the future.
