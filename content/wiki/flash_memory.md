Flash Memory, or Flash [RAM](/wiki/ram.html "Random Access Memory") is actually a form of [ROM](/wiki/rom.html "Read Only Memory").

It is a non-volatile memory, that will store data until the data is changed, and will retain its data without power. It is slower than DRAM - Dynamic [RAM](/wiki/ram.html "Random Access Memory"), or true [ROM](/wiki/rom.html "Read Only Memory"), and the process of writing to it is more complicated.

Flash [RAM](/wiki/ram.html "Random Access Memory") used to be pretty expensive, but now it is being used in a multitude of Cameras, Phones, PDA's, and many of the [firmware](/wiki/firmware.html "Software burned into a non volatile memory chip") chips in your PC - the prices have fallen dramatically compared with around 5 to 10 years ago.

Flash Cards are becoming prevalent, and look set to replace the Floppy Disk once and for all.
