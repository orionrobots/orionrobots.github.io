This is an abbreviation for an Integrated Circuit.

An Integrated Circuit is a circuit, or many circuit blocks reduced down and miniaturised to fit on a small package. These are more commonly referred to as "Chips". some of these may contain many thousands, or millions of Transistors and other components in one package. It is this which has allowed such vast miniaturisation of circuits to take place in the last decade or so.
