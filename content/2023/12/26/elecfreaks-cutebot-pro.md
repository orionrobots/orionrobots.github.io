This week I found time to unbox, review and play with the Elecfreaks Smart Cutebot Pro. This is a robot kit based around the BBC micro:bit, and is a great way to get started with robotics.

I was sent this kit by Elecfreaks, and I was really excited to get started with it. The micro:bit is a great way for people to get starting with programming, and with a range of built in sensors, is a great way to get started with robotics.

See the Youtube video for what I found in the box, and my thoughts on the kit.
