I have contributed to a feature published this month in The Magpi - the Raspberry Pi Magazine. In it I show how to use a Raspberry Pi Pico with a MeArm robot arm, and use Micropython to program a web controlled robot with step record and playback capabilities

This is the process I used for [MeArm Robot Arm with Pico - Record and Playback](/2023/06/05/mearm-robot-arm-with-pico-recorded-actions) and [Two MeArm Robot Arms Play Pass-the-parcel](/2023/06/12/mearm-robot-two-arms-pass-the-parcel).

As well as my robot arm fun, there's plenty of other awesome Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi Pico things, like making game engines and using the Camera Module.
