Today I've cut two more styrene chassis plates for building the robot rover from [Robotics at Home with Raspberry Pi Pico](https://packt.link/5swS2). This article has paid links.

## Why build two more?

I'm going to keep the original one for visiting conferences with, which will have no modifications.

As I build the other two, I will be using the build for video footage.

I'm building the others to experiment with other options, so I can try swapping out the Bluefruit BLE UART for other options, like a Bluefruit BLE SPI friend, an NRF based board, or trying a PicoW when there's PicoW bluetooth stack support in CircuitPython.

I can experiment with Wifi options, check the memory still works with the Monte Carlo Localisation (a major concern with the Pico W), or try integrating the esp32 as a Wifi coprocessor again.

I can also experiment with replacing the front VL53L1X sensor for other sensor options. Keeping the same basic rover chassis and testing different electronics combinations will mean I can try a lot of experimentation, and support readers who vary the components they use.

## How far am I through

I've so far just cut the two chassis out of styrene, using drawings from FreeCAD as templates, and cutting through them.

Now I have the two rough parts, this means an evening of sanding with an audiobook or TV show for entertainment.

## About Robotics at Home with Raspberry Pi Pico

[Robotics at Home with Raspberry Pi Pico](https://packt.link/5swS2) is a step-by-step journey for building a low cost rover with sensors and interesting algorithms.

The book starts from a position of no robotics experience with perhaps beginner level programming knowledge and takes them through designing, building and programming this robot.
