On Tuesday the 17th January 2019, I gave a talk at [Richmond New Technology](https://www.meetup.com/Richmond-New-Technology-Meetup/) on Creative Technology with Hobby Robotics where I made clear that robotics is about three main ideas:

* Making things in your own way, in your own time.
* Doing it because you want to (even if there are some hard bits to get through first).
* Getting just outside your comfort zone.

Many people at the talk had questions, and wanted further information about what I do.

Some resources, and contact information about myself, and the coder dojo's (which many people seemed interested in).

First the book: Learn Robotics Programming, by Danny Staple - <https://www.amazon.co.uk/Learn-Robotics-Programming-autonomous-Raspberry/dp/1789340748/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1547801501&sr=8-1&keywords=learn+robotics+programming>.
