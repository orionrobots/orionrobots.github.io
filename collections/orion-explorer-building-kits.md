This collection has what you will need to get a robot up and running in no time. Just add batteries and a bit of simple code on the Arduino - and you will be able to have a robot moving about the floor with flashing lights too. The Orion Explorer Mobile Robotics Platform kits give you a good starting base, and the sensors and communication modules allow you to extend it to do more.

This platform is solderless - the only tools needed are a screwdriver, USB cable and a computer. Even relatively old machines are fine (a 2006 EEE PC worked fine).

Make a real and easy homemade robot with fewer steps than major brand robot kits, while at the same time having much more flexibility - with many spare IO pins on the Arduino and a number of mounting holes on the robot chassis to add additional sensors or actuators (moving stuff) to it.

Think of how quickly you'll get this running - and then start to make something more exciting with it!
