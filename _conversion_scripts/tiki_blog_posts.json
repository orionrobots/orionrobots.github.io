[{"FROM_UNIXTIME(created)": "2006-07-25 05:16:33","data": "One shortcoming of working in a Windows environment is not being able to bulk rename files as easily as in unix, or even DOS. I am also not even sure Gnome or KDE have really taken great measures to sort this out.

In unix, the use of crazy sed scripts with a little shell magic really gave massive full regular expression file renaming, and can even be linked with Subversion (SVN) and CVS. In DOS, the ren command could deal with wild card replacement, however, the standard windows explorer bulk rename, which consists of highlighting a group of files, and renaming one of them, was extremely weak, allowing the initial name and then every repeat name being the same with a bracketed auto-numeric expression.

So I hit the web to find a serious renaming tool, and found a little cache of freeware tools to do the job: [http://www.freewarehome.com/System_Utilities/File_Management/Multiple_File_Renaming_t.html|List of multiple file renaming tools.]

After looking around, I tried 1-4a rename, a simple but powerful tool with reasonable pattern matching and replacement, autonumbering (with padding), and it even has possibilities of hex numbering (handy for some programming situations), case changing, and song pattern naming for media collections.

The only shame really is that the tool does not link with SVN, and that the source control UI\'s for windows do not have any kind of bulk rename. Maybe Tortoise SVN or Rapid SVN could have a go at adding one to their arsenal, which would increase their usefulness when looking at directories full of image files or similar items that may need renaming. Its not an operation that one should plan to do very often, but it also need not be so painful.

For those unix bods - here is an example shell script to achieve this (which I ended up using in Cygwin bash in the end because it had to happen with SVN):
{CODE()}
newname=0; \\
for currentfile in blah*.bmp
do
  newname=`echo $currentfile | \\
    sed \'s/blah/something_else_/;s/_\\([0-9]\\)\\./_0\\1\\./\'`
  echo ${currentfile} \\-\\> ${newname}
  svn rename ${currentfile} ${newname}
done
{CODE}

The Windows scripting host may offer another (equally non user-friendly) way to do this without Cygwin.

GUI tools for these really would be nice, although clearly regular expressions are not very user friendly. What ideas are there for giving such pattern matching power in a user friendly manner? I would really love to hear some, and I hope somebody somewhere is juggling the concept of it.

The best I have seen, is the Apple OS X Automator. I am not sure if SVN actions can be placed in it, but user friendly expression base renames can most definitely be put in. Perhaps Gnome and KDE will follow suit there, and eventually we will see something similar in Vista.

Well it looks like I am going to be learning C#.net.  We are going to be building (as discussed) a multi-platform, advanced 3D Cad system here. As a result of this, I am now considering a number of cross platform systems. My favourite - as mentioned was ((Python)) along with wxWidgets - which is very cross platform, and has an easy learning curve. However - oprting to the ((Pocket PC)) is still an ongoing saga, and the ((GUI)) ((API)) is not quite there yet. Dot net has its disadvantages - in that i would need to learn a new language - but its similarity to so many others I know means that is a matter of time and practice more than any real learning, and of course it really does not live up to cross platform. While Mono is a very reasonable dot net porting project - it is hampered by the lack of ((GUI)) compatibility. Indeed - the only thing which seems to be able to offer consistent ((GUI)) ((API|APIs)) on many platforms is Java - which is incredibly slow, and although I know it well - I would prefer not to use it if I do not have to. The best case for this would really be if the wxPython implementation on the Pocket PC become more usable - and then I would be with an API and language I am firmly comfortable using.

!Freeforming
Some of you may have noticed I have started to place ((FreeForming)) articals on the website. I am going to go into a series on this - and have been touching up on my POVRAY skills to try and produce diagrams to try and explain this. Bear with me - it is very, very difficult to explain the steps taken to freeform an item. Anyway - I have taken a decision to stop using POVray for this sort of thing, and start using larger commercial CAD systems. Firstly they are easier to use. Secondly they are designed for engineering, where POV is really designed for artistic rendering.

!The Great Ball Contraptions
We have decided, after our last group meeting, that OrionRobots is going to be making a few modules for the Lego Gerat Ball Contraption, and then at some point find a suitable convention to display it. This started off as a design challenge, leading to a building a device using sensors and outputs fully (which is new to the junior club at this point), and because of the ingenuity of their designs - I felt a plan forming in the back of my head - an automatic door locker, a lift (or a few), a football goal kicker, a machine that automatically takes a ball from a goal net round and feeds it up on to a placing field, a couple of interesting chute, or conveyor based food dispensors. As each of the kids presented their ideas to me- the flurry of articals on Lugnet began to ring in my mind - and thats when I announced to them that we were going to take these ideas and use them to create our ball contraptions. We are going to start the build next week - and might soon be looking to purchase a number of them Lego Footballs. Photos will be appearing soon on the website!

Well thats all for today folks - I am tired, and have already written a small volume.","title": "Freeforming, Ball Contraptions and CAD Software","postId": 3}, {"FROM_UNIXTIME(created)": "2005-02-08 12:21:59","data": "If you will excuse my ..ahem.. small pun, I thought it fitting to mention that pancake day and Chinese New Year are so close to each other.
First - a big Gung Hey Fat Choi to all my readers!
I thought of taking (and this may be a bold step) the normal pancake we use for pancake day, and marrying this with crispy duck and hoi sin. Considering the normal pancakes used to roll the duck are thinner - that should be interesting.
We will probably have this with noodles, and follow it up with traditional sweet lemon sauce pancakes.

Now - to try and keep the focus here - I challenge anyone here to make a pancake flipping robot. It needs to probably sense how cooked the pancake is (or have a timer to judge it), it would need to break an egg and beat it, then mix the milk and flour sugar (it might need hoppers for milk/sugar - and an egg lift to safely carry the egg - which would be an interstign proposition itself). The robot would then drop the mixture, with a small misting of oil, onto a pan, and time it so the side is done. It could then flip the pancake - either using a utensil (ie an arm with a wide flat gripper to get under the pancake and rapidly turn it over), or the more fun way - by using the pan.
Now the reason I said a flipping robot, is even if you take away all of the cooking, storage and mixing of batter, flipping is enough of a challenge to get right - misjudge it, and you get a right mess...

On a less seasonal note - we are now looking to buy lego balls for our Great Ball Contraption modules.

This is due to the fact that the group was hosted at my flat in East Finchley, and I will be moving to another part of London. However, there are plans that the group may later (when all the fuss of moving has died down) be held in the Green Man center or in a more central location - however this will raise costs, and therefore subs will have to be charged. I do hope all those who took part in the group will stay in contact, continue to build and use the website for sharing their results with the community.

As a result of this, I will firmly start to focus the next few sessions on effectively using the CAD tools ((LDraw)), ((LeoCad)) and ((MLCad)) to document your ((Lego)) designs, as well as getting photos of your robots on the site (especially non-Lego ones), and how to use the [tiki-list_blogs.php|blogging], [tiki-forums.php|forum] and [tiki-index.php|wiki] tools here.

My own designs are to use a ball pump (which we can try when we have enough balls), a step ladder style thing with tipping trolleys. I tried building a large chain (having very few link tread peices) using axle joiner peices - but have so far not tried deploying it, and besides I didnt have enough of the right peices to make it as long as I need it.

It seems that the growth of AI spam filters using learning techniques may lead us to finding a vaccine for AIDS. One problem with aids is that it changes very regularly, and finding common qualities between strains of the virus can be fairly elusive. These kind of things are exactly what spam filters are designed to do.

Huge amounts of time and money have been invested in spam, as it hits the bottom line of so many companies who businesses are based on email. Consider the storage, networking and other costs when spam gets through in massive quantities you can see why. Using these systems have become very easy, for example on OrionRobots own email system, I have a false-negatives and false-positives folder to teach the Bayesian filters on our system when it misses something, and as it has gained what could only be called experience, the number that get through has become very small indeed. 

Now an interesting question I have is could this herald a new future in medicine? Could these techniques be used to create new cancer cures which would be able to rapidly distinguish and exterminate cancerous cells? This technology, mixed with ((SwarmBots)) and ((Nano Bots)) could really hold the key to a sudden surge in world health and quality of life.

This was almost an inevitable, small robots, designed to be placed through an incision, can now be used for small scale medical procedures. This kind of technology has been predicted for some time by SciFi, and will pave the way to plenty of fantastic, and some quite worrying developments.

The robots, developed by The Ritsumeikan University and announced on the 26th February 2007, are about 20mm long by 10mm wide.

The researchers have created a number of different prototypes based on the technology with specialized sensors and manipulators. These include a drug delivery system, a set of tiny manipulators (forceps) and a camera for imaging as well as other sensors and manipulators. The robots are encased in bio-compatible plastics, and uses a magnetic system for positioning and movement in the body. 

Looking somewhat like a high-tech scarab, the system allows minute surgery to be conducted without massively invasive procedures. It is definitely a step in the right direction. One potential drawback is that it is still connected to the controlling computer via a cable. The cable may double up as a tether to retrieve an errant robot. This possibly makes it slightly less manoeuvrable than a completely wireless model, but the possibility of loosing one in a body and then requiring further invasive surgery is not a very welcome one. 

Examples of application are to send a robot on a mission to seek and destroy cancerous tissue in an area, by imaging and identifying then delivering a localised dose of a drug designed to destroy it. The potential is endless. As small robots like these, and smaller ((nano bots|nanobots)) progress, medical operations will increasingly be a top application for them, and experience as well as procedures involving them will become mature and possibly commonplace. They have potential to carry out rapid, non or low invasive procedures, and then be extracted simply. This would make many very tense and difficult operations much simpler. For example being able to perform heart surgery without needing to go through the rib cage.

A long time ago, I created a pneumatic engine with ((Lego)) ((Pneumatic)) elements. It seems that the file I put on OrionRobots originally referenced many unofficial parts, and was unfortunately referenced only in a forum post from the old Zope site, which was 3 or more years ago.

So I have reposted the file.

This system is based upon three pneumatic cylinders, and they will continuously extend and contract in a cycle as long as pressure is supplied. This could be used to drive some interesting activity. You will note that the cylinder heads are each connected to ((pneumatic)) valves, which in turn set the extension of the next cylinder in the chain. The last switch is then connected to the first cylinder. The design could be extended for as long as there are parts for it, and enough pressure can be supplied.

This fascinated me, as well as the children who attended the OrionRobots club in 2005, and practically any visitor who started playing with it. 

Sadly, it has long been disassembled for parts, however, the ((LDraw)) ((CAD)) file remains. Find the CAD file in the links below. ((LSynth)) has been used to create the tubing, LPub, LGEO and POV were used for rendering it. I have not created a schematic for the engine, and may do so in the future to help explain its operation.

I am still getting to grips with the idea of having the site on a machine that I dont have absolute power over but the ups outweigh the downs.

The cons are:
*I must pay for the service - but the rate is actually very affordable. 
*I dont have as much control - but this is soemthing I can deal with. 
*I wont be able to copy over old emails in imap accounts (sorry!) - but they will still be available on serverus.orionrobots.co.uk for those who want them.

The pros:
*I can turn off the dusty old server and its pariphernalia taking up a substantial part of our lounge - and redistribute or sell its parts.
*I dont have to worry about keeping the UPS serviced.
*I dont have to worry about backups so often (the hosting service is backed up!)
*I dont have to think about network faults at e7even (I do NOT recommend this company for any purposes) or my routers/network causing issues.

They have now unveiled a humanoid robot, and are competing directly with the likes of the ((Honda)) ((Asimo)), the ((Sony)) (QRio)) and the ((Toyota)) Unnamed Trumpet Player.

This robot EMIEW has a trick up its sleeve. Instead of going for the all realistic walking system like the ((QRio)) and the ((Asimo)), they have gone for a wheeled desing (as did ((Toyota))).  The systems works a little like the ((SegWay)) using sensors to keep the robot upright. Their philosophy behind this design was to ensure the robot could travel at speeds that could keep up with humans - 6km/h. They describe it as running - although this doesnt really sound right for a wheeled robot. In comparison, the ((Honda)) ((Asimo)) can only acheive around 2.3km/h.

The reasoning behind this was that it is very frustrating having to slow pace, and wait for a robot to catch up. However - this also sacrifices some of the flexibility offered by the Legged versions - so this robot wont be able to do fancy footwork dancing, surfing, or even climb stairs. The ((QRio)) and ((Asimo)) are crowd pullers on some of these abilities alone.

It is however (please excuse the pun) a step in the right direction - as although wheels may be seen as a step back, it is raising the stakes by moving faster.

Emiew is an acronym for Excellent Mobility and Interactive Existence as Workmate. It was developed at Hitachi\'s Mechanical Engineering Research Laboratory Robotics Technology Project. The gorups name is actually a cumbersome translation of what is probably a much more elegant Japanese moniker.

{img src=show_image.php?id=189&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=189}

The robot is at a relatively short 1.3m high, and appears to have dextrous five fingered hands. It looks a little round and squat though - with a rather barrel shaped body. Its wheels allow it to lean either side, as well as forward or back. They also have relatively good speech capabilities with a 1000 word vocabulary, and two of the Emiews - Pal & Chum were shown to reporters at the press conference when revealing the robot - they could be linked with Dog Food ad campaigns here in the Uk!

Toshihiko Horiuchi, the project leader had a few comments on its creation \"We aimed to create a robot that could live and co-exist with people.\", he continues with \"We want to make the robots useful for people ... If the robots moved slower than people, users would be frustrated.\".

{img src=show_image.php?id=188&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=188}

Pal, one of the robots also commented \"I want to be able to walk about in places like Shinjuku and Shibuya in the future without bumping into people and cars.\" - These are some of the busiest shopping areas in Japan. To acheive this it has sensor in its head, around its waist and near the wheels.

The point is that it will be space saving, and very suitable for a single professional living in the city. Most definately an interesting concept.

* Technical - There will be points for showing technical skill, the use of pneumatics, or sensors, or simply a very good mechanical design will win points in this category
* Style - The model has to look good - the way the balls move should show off a bit of fun, and exposed technical workings are exactly what we want to see, as well as generally well placed style peices giving the module a bit of a theme
* Theme - Following that - there will be points if a team can make a module that is seriously themed
* Low motor count - I will give lots of points if you can run it on one motor.
* Low Peice count - While sometimes big is beautiful, we also beleive in keeping it simple - if there are two models with similar characteristics, the one with fewer peices will get additional points
* Low weight - I will be weighing the entries - this really is a similar criteria to peice count, but now the kind of peices are important too.

The teams have already been allocated, and we have one group using the ((Lego RCX)) and another using the ((Lego Cybermaster)). There may also be a ((SpyBotics)) based module. This seems overkill - as a team may get the whole thing working on a single motor and battery box- which is great.

The transport sequence is undoubtedly one of the coolest parts of the film, and is ample inspiration to anyone considering building a ((Great Ball Contraption)) module. The characters are cute and funny, and while the good guy/bad guy divide is clear cut - as you would expect in a family film, there are definitely some &quot;in&quot; jokes that only an adult would get. It sounds good too, with voices from the likes of Hale Berry, Mel Brooks, Ewan McGregor and the ever amusing ((Robin Williams)) as Fender.

It is definitely more kids film than adult, and kids will go for it.

I will also ensure that all the members have full editorial access to the site, to post their creations and to the blog.

I will still be building robots, and some of the advanced members will still be invited over for this - but I will not be teaching or hosting large meetings at this point. I will also be building my own GBC module - having not attempted one between teaching yet.

This [http://www.apple.com/trailers/touchstone/hitchhikersguidetothegalaxy/trailer_3/hh_trailer_large.html|trailer] is by far the best.","title": "Top Film Trailers","postId": 14}, {"FROM_UNIXTIME(created)": "2007-03-21 17:40:29","data": "The UK Ministry Of Defence (MoD) have decided to take a leaf from the DARPA book, and created their own grand challenge.

As the original did, this will intrigue and bring forth robot builders, makers and inventors from all over the country and potentially the globe to take part. I will certainly be keeping an eye on this.

!!So what is the challenge?
The MoD would like to encourage design of an autonomous vehicle capable of scouting out urban areas, and assessing for any potential threats. The vehicle must be able to remain undetected where possible. It should be able to deal well with returned fire if discovered, or be cheap enough to be expendable.

This is already enough for a serious challenge just to make an autonomous vehicle that can travel any reasonable distance in terrain that is not necessarily well mapped or known. Experience from the DARPA Grand Challenge so far has shown how difficult this can be.

To then actually gather intelligence and report back ads a further element, where sensory and telemetry equipment must be thought through. The initial draft of applicants to the challenge, opened by the Defence Minister Lord Drayson, may only get this far.

Then the other important part is to remain undetected. This means low noise drive systems - which could be pretty difficult on rough terrain like rubble. A good acoustic profile could mean everything when trying to avoid detection. Since it may not be easy to get a robot in position back to base, then transmission protocols must be further refined to ensure that they are not easily detected or intercepted, and long range enough to allow the intelligence to get back to the troops. The design will need to have thought out profile - keeping a small, or inconspicuous shape, as well as camouflage of sorts, so it does not stand out in the environment.

In short, it would have to be designed taking into account some of the training that those who would be involved in stealth operations would have had. 

Keeping costs down is played off versus actual armour or ability to take fire. Of course excellent ability to avoid detection may mean neither are necessary. Stealth is by far the most important factor, as it would also alert enemy troops that friendly troops are moving in.

!!Where, how and when?
The competition is open to all kinds of companies, institutions and academic groups, with the MOD  proposing to finance and offer a development contract to the winners. When putting in the R & D for this, competitors may apply for funding in the form of grants from the MOD, but depending on their status, they may also be required to fund themselves.

The first event dates have not been announced, only that things will be kicked off (possibly for team applicants only - no spectators) at Copehill Down in Wiltshire, UK around January 2008. The grand finale will take place late in the Summer of 2008. 

You have only until the 15th May to get your applications in - you can enter through the website, and will go through a qualification process.

First this video: [http://youtube.com/watch?v=6rLruH5pCRk|Cable In The Classroom - the Screen Savers] with footage of JP Browns cubesolver at work.

Second, another solver, this time in ((Fischertechnik)) - [http://youtube.com/watch?v=-mZ0CXcTozY|FischerTechnik Cube Solver]. It is much slower than the other attempts seen, although it is also pretty different in the way that the outer limbs \"jostle\" the cube into position, the top limb clamps down, and then the turntable underneath rotates, holding the cube in a square depression. It is definitely worth seeing.

We actually went for doing a good fun robot brawling and racing day, using the ((Lego Manas)) to build robots and our small arena setup. Photos and full log to come.

The reason the photos and the rest are on hold, is I have been having horrible troubles with a new motherboard and processor setup I bought. I invested in an AMD Sempron and a Gigabyte K8NS motherboard. Since fitting it, I was having trouble booting into Windows XP, and on a safe mode boot up, it stopped after loading \"mup.sys\". After a great deal of searching, it turns out that the next thing to load is a critical XP component - part of the kernel. 

This was worrying - as it could be hardware problems or conflicts, or it could simply be drivers. As I had recently used the same mobo and processor combination in another machine with no problems, I was worrying that I had missed something or let the processor overheat.

There were suggestions to use the repair mode of windows setup - which didn\'t work, to try and reinstall - which always ended up the same way. After a few days of really playing with it - moving memory cards around, removing all the USB devices, stripping it down to basics, I finally saw a thread on the nForce chipset and this problem which suggested it was the nForce SW ((IDEHardware|IDE)) drivers, which are installed by the motherboard driver disk, but are optional when using the nVidia reference drivers.

It turned out that was the culprit, and by not installing it, my system seems to be okay. Now one application I am wary of is Semantic Norton Systemworks - which was the last application installed before the whole thing started. I will be trying it with a little caution tonight.

If it all works - I will be definitely blogging the weekends activities fully. Until then I don\'t have access to the computer with the photos on it.","title": "Weekend Group Log still to come, and problems with XP","postId": 15}, {"FROM_UNIXTIME(created)": "2005-04-06 16:11:55","data": "On Saturday, as it was sadly the last day for the East Finchley Robotics Club at Prospect Ring, I decided to go back to basics, and do a challenge that was good old fun for the kids.

I decided to go for a few rounds of sumo, a timed race, and a few drop tests. And since it was likely to be the last one based in East Finchley, I decided to ride prizes on it. 

The group who had the most points at the end of the rounds would get to choose there prizes from a big pile first. There was a PlayStation One, Babylon Five Series 4 VHS Box Set, A Games Workshop Army Carry Case, A Bunch Of Ladybird Disney Hardbacks, and Other bits and bobs.

The spec I had written for the challenge is as follows:
^
!Good Ole\' Robot Brawl

This challenge is meant to get back to basics for a bit of fun, and there are prizes!

Each team will use a manas handset and motor block, and build a robot around it. The robots will be required to have a sumo brawl, and race - so think about both speed as well as taking a good knock.

The teams have 1 hour to build the robots, and the challenge events are expected to last around an hour.

Teams will not be allowed to modify their robots between rounds and events - no exceptions!

!!Scoring:
!!!Weight
There are 4 points for the lightest robot

!!!Best Engineered
There are 4 points for the model which comes across as having the best engineering - this means interesting structure, use of gears or other advanced techniques.

!!!Style
There are also 2 points for style - this means the robot that is simply the best looking.

!!!Race
Each robot will race a course set out using the set pieces. The robots are timed, and the team with the best time will win 10 points. There is a 10 second penalty for crossing yellow striped lines, except of course the start and finish lines.

!!!Sumo
This is the big event. There will be three rounds - with ten points per won round. A robots looses if there robot suffers critical damage (falls apart and cant move) or if it goes outside the arena. There is 4 minutes per round - and in the case of a deadlock - points are awarded on damage, style and aggression.

!!!Drop Test
The teams can reconstruct their vehicles, and prepare for a drop test. This means being dropped from knee height until the vehicle is critically damaged. I was giving out 3 points per drop, minus the number of non-critical chunks that fall off. I define non-critical as superficial style pieces, or one or two bricks falling off. If the structure breaks into two separate big chunks - that was critical.

!!!Behaviour
Also - to keep spirits good, there are 12 points for the best behaved team.

This gives each team a potential of more than 60 points - I expect the points to be somewhat more distributed than this.
^

!What actually happened
Well the boys arrived on the day, and although the turnout was low (only 4), spirits were high. There was, after all, some decent prizes for grabs, and the points would be added to their previous totals.

They got down and built well. Dale successfully distracted little Danny - but I let him no what Dale was up to - and he wised up. I paired the teams - Danny with Gabriel, and Dale with Janak.

My reasoning is that Dale is a Solid Engineer, and a Good Driver, Janak is a good team member and gets on with it. Danny is an excellent driver, and Gabriel is an excellent engineer - so I thought this pairing would even up the odds - how wrong I was!

Twenty minutes in, the teams have found their wheels - and I was already worried about Danny and Gabriel\'s choice. Gabriel was worried that it wouldn\'t steer very well, and to be frank, so was I. But Danny was the teams chosen driver (for all but one of the Sumo rounds) - so Gabriel went with it. They had chosen the blocky old [http://peeron.com/cgi-bin/invcgis/inv/sets/5248-1?withpics=yes|20 x 30 technic wheels]. There construction was fairly heavy, and only they bothered with any style pieces.

Dale & Janak went with the large balloon tyres, and went for a minimalist construction - but with a lot of pinned beams for front and rear bumpers - these looked fairly effective.

As construction was nearing its end, each team were now testing their vehicles. Dale & Janak had four wheel drive, and theirs steered fairly easy. Danny & Gabriel were having problems, and I gave the teams an additional 10 minutes - not enough.

We then took some initial photos of the vehicles before they ran into trouble.
Danny & Gabriel Proudly Holding Their Creation
{img src=show_image.php?id=192&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=192}
Gabriel was really concerned - as they still couldn\'t get it to turn - the large wheels dragged, and the fact that they were wider at the non-driving end turned those front wheels into dead weight when they tried to steer. Ouch.
Some more close-ups of it. Note the front forks, and the gears used for style on the extra wheels.
{img src=show_image.php?id=193&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=193} {img src=show_image.php?id=194&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=194} {img src=show_image.php?id=195&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=195}

Dale & Janak with theirs
{img src=show_image.php?id=196&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=196}
There model has a lot of empty space, but those balloon tyres did make it steer well. You can see the bumpers quite clearly - as well as the four wheel drive.
Note also that Danny & Gabriel are still testing their vehicle behind - trying to work out if there was anything they could do last minute before the challenges started. I like Janaks T-Shirt ;-)

I must admit - with my poor photography - I missed the front and rear bumper detail - but trust me, Dale went to town a bit with the pins in those.
{img src=show_image.php?id=198&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=198} {img src=show_image.php?id=199&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=199} {img src=show_image.php?id=200&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=200}

So I made my first judgements. Style had to go to Gabriel & Danny, as Dale & Janak did not even consider any style pieces.

The two models face to face
{img src=show_image.php?id=201&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=201}

On weight, Dales team scooped an easy 4 points, and with four wheel drive and pinned construction, they get the 4 four engineering.

So 8 points to Dale & Janak to 2 for Danny & Gabriel.

We now prepare for the race, Dales team volunteer to go first, with Dale driving. He makes steady progress, although I soon realise that the strong sun is not helping the ((Lego Manas)) infrared system much. So Dale makes sure he keeps a shadow on his robot when possible.

Dale takes the tricky corner (its not that tricky!) - Janak is providing the shadow cover for him.
{img src=show_image.php?id=202&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=202}

They make a good time of 2 minutes and 25 with no penalties.

It is time for Danny & Gabriel to go, with Danny chosen as driver - this is not a surprise - Danny has won most race events we have had before with his driving.

Unfortunately - they really cannot steer- their buggy pretty much only goes in a straight line - it can only turn very slowly, and possibly by getting momentum and pulling back on one set of wheels - a real skid steer...
{img src=show_image.php?id=203&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=203}
Danny makes a few attempts to turn a corner, and then just bolts for the finish line - which if you ignore the penalty areas, is a straight line from the start line. 

Unfortunately - this takes 3 minutes and 10 seconds, with 3 or 4 penalties. This left him and Gabriel a little disappointed- and with the modification rule, there was nothing they could do.

We then started the sumo round. There was a little confusion over which part was the arena, and the inner square - but I allowed a rematch after it was settled. In the first round, one of G & D\'s tires slipped off the mat, but they complained that most of their vehicle was still on - okay - I let them haggle that, but let the rule stand that the whole vehicle must be pushed off to win. There was some jostling, but with better manoeuvrability, Dale was able to dodge Danny, and push him out while he was still driving the wrong way.

10 Points to D & J.

The second sumo round saw Gabriel versus Dale - for some reason, Janak didn\'t go for driving any of the rounds. Again - the manoeuvrability saw D & J win again. 10 points.. This was turning into a whitewash...

The final sumo round was Danny versus Dale again. 2 minutes in, Dale rammed Danny with those bumpers, and a drive wheel fell off. Danny\'s vehicle was virtually useless, and Dale (a little gloatingly I may add) pushed him off. 10 points again.

I took one more photo of each before the drop tests started
{img src=show_image.php?id=204&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=204} {img src=show_image.php?id=205&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=205}

On the drop test, Dale again volunteered to be first - Gabriel and Danny were glad to have a little time to ensure there model was rebuilt.

Dale and Janaks vehicle lost a few small pieces on the first drop, but made it through 3 before taking critical damage. He got a total of 6 points.

Gabriel and Danny\'s fell apart on the second drop - one side the manas and a beam, and the rest of the vehicle on the other. A total of 3 points.

Drop Test Aftermath
{img src=show_image.php?id=206&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=206}
Now considering Dales gloating, and distraction techniques, I had to award the 12 behaviour points to Danny & Gabriel - but alas - it was really not enough. The final score was 54 to 17.

Anyway while this was the end of an era, this is not the end of the club, although this was the last event held at Prospect Ring, we will be starting a new group at our new location around August.","title": "Round up of the Challenge on Saturday the 2nd April 2005","postId": 16}, {"FROM_UNIXTIME(created)": "2006-06-30 00:27:53","data": "It seems that the ((Lego)) ((Mindstorms)) ((NXT)) kit started shipping last week and have now started arriving.

I am waiting rather intently for mine and maybe I will finish the Lathe I am building using the ((NXT)) as opposed to the ((RCX)) + ((PIC)) combination I was originally planning - the ability to get feedback on the motors positioning may simplify its design by a huge amount.

I will be putting work in progress photos of the programmable lathe up soon, so readers can actually see what I am on about here.

This is not completely unfounded, but recent news shows that the Redmond giant is clearly thinking things through here, and has realised exactly how bad these things could go. In a recent case, a company is trying to file suit against another over patent infringement on what is essentially an accelerator pedal. MS and also Cisco have come out in defence of the other company, in protest to the silliness of the obvious patent.

Maybe the robotics discipline is safer than previously thought even with the entry of MS. The only question is, were the things that are now obvious, obvious to engineers in the same field 5 or 10 years ago? When things are moving so quickly due to innovation and research, that may be very, very hard to gauge.

Microsoft and Cisco appear to be complaining that the law on establishing patents is far too lenient, and that more checks and balances on the appropriateness of a patent need to be considered. Maybe introducing a requirement of having a hearing with an independent expert who is technically qualified and experienced in the field to judge how obvious or unique the concept is might be a big step forwards in guaranteeing some kind of public benefit and preventing rubbish patents being filed en mass.

Combine this on regular patents with an alternate option of rapid short patents as described [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/02/06/four_year_patent_term/|here] - and the system may suddenly improve the innovation and dynamics of the technology market significantly. 

All of this is all playing out in the US, so who knows how it will affect UK and EU patent law.

While I have been plaing around with building a Ball Contraption - or more to the point, trying to coach the club kids into building some, I identified the need for a good ball hopper.

If you look at these first photos - you can clearly see that with a simple hopper, Lego balls tend to catch on the bricks, and you get jams. This was how I explained the purpose of the device to the kids at the club.

So I thought about building a mechanism to stir the balls. My inspiration came from seeing the stirrers used in the belt lift components in RokenBok. I created the basket itself, and the actual mechanism to turn the stirrers - as seen from this (poorly taken) underside shot.

{img src=show_image.php?id=215&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=215}

I then experimented with a few different types of stirring arm - I tried (my intial design) the large ((Lego)) classic space radar dishes - [http://peeron.com/inv/parts/4285b]. These didnt seem to work too well. I tried a few different ideas, and settled on the studless 3 bladed liftarm piece [http://peeron.com/inv/parts/44374] - which was most effective.

Firstly (and the link may be tenuous) I discovered ((The Transformers)) game for the Playstation 2. The game is great fun, in that you get to choose from three of the autobots (Optimus Prime, Hot Rod and Red Alert) and augment them with the collectable minicons - smaller transformers with cool abilities. You can transform while playing, and it is a third person shooter with some melee battle as well - though for low power enemies - you can transform and ruin them down like skittles. It can be a little frustrating - and the difficulty level is fairly high. The scenery is nice, and the actual bots look good. It is overall a fun and addictive game, which is quite good looking, and will appeal to new audiences and nostalgic players alike. [http://orionrobots.co.uk/tiki-directory_redirect.php?siteId=121|A more detailed review]

I also rediscovered the ((mindstorms)) [http://mindstorms.lego.com/stormrunner/start-frameset.asp|Storm Runner Game] - ((Lego)) turned off this game some time ago, and I was glad to see it back - I have spent a fair bit of time over the last couple of days playing it. It runs in a browser -although you can only save games with Internet Explorer and a Microsoft ((VM)) setup. The basic idea is that you have been stranded on a distant planet, with only a bay capable of constructing large ((RCX)) based robots. You must construct them, and then program them so you can explore the planet and eventually find a way off it. Graphically it is a 2D top down - but the real magic is that you get to use your ((RCX)) code skills with the game - which is quite fun.

Meanwhile, after helping my sister with some basic explainations of electronics behind the theremin - I have decided I will start to enhance the wiki pages on electronic components, and try and add simple diagrams and links for the terminology on all of them. I like the water pipe analogies - they often help students grasp the very fundamentals. I may then add a specialist artical explaining the theremin. As way of courtesy - I will link this post to it when I am done.

This was the result of the first time I challenged a team headed up by Dale to build a robot with dual motor control and go over a course. Danny and Dale both took turns in driving it. It was a fairly wide vehical, and somwhat quirky. The front middle wheel tended to drag on the floor when the robot turned. Built on the 25th September - using a remote I had designed for the RCX using four touch sensors - two RCX sensors, and two from the Cybermaster. It had a habit of breaking at the plates upon which each of the side wheels was attached.

{img src=show_image.php?id=156&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=156}
This was another much later effort - which was not only quite easy to manouvre, but very compact and demonstrated a much more mature building style. Being a 4 wheel drive, it had great traction, and saw off a team headed by Gabriel in a pushing power contest - this one actually managed to push a tub of 80 CD\'s across the finish line. While it is not clear from the LDraw diagram - the inner cavity housed a micro-motor, and the space shuttle fibre-optic peice - which gave this a fantastic style aspect as well.

This was a basic ((Lego)) gripper I created as a study.
{img src=show_image.php?id=226&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=226}

The gripper used a single mini double acting ((pneumatic)) cylinder and liftarms. I decided to use the 8t gears for the actual grip at the end, but the gripper is designed for more of a scooping action.

{img src=show_image.php?id=227&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=227}

As you can see from the shot of it open, there is clearly an upper and lower side to it.

{img src=show_image.php?id=228&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=228}

It is controlled (for demonstration purposes) by a single ((lego)) valve and basic pump.

At the same time, I also did a study using a geared down motor with a clutch gear, and a light sensor head. The idea was that the rear liftarm would stop it going outside a preset range, and a program would be created to scan periodically side-to-side, and attempt to judge which area was brightest.

{img src=show_image.php?id=229&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=229}

I am not sure what this was - I remember it being an attempt to make some kind of scorpion like mech from the Bionacle parts but I never quite liked it. I took photos to share anyway:

The two blue bionacle masks where meant to be large bulbous insect like eyes, and the front green bionacle claw was intended to be menacing mouthparts. The rear tail section could be angled up - but I could not get the stiffness in the joints for it to stay there.

	Some time ago, my wife and mother conspired to accidentally damage my <a class=\"wiki wiki_page\" href=\"Cybot\" title=\"Cybot\">Cybot</a>. First my mother manager to damage the tabs on the front panels holding the <a class=\"wiki wiki_page\" href=\"Infra+Red\" title=\"A type of EM radiation commonly used for digital communications\">Infra Red</a> dome, and then may wife managed to snap the Castor.</p>
<p>
	I used the dome parts from the racing cybot and managed to repair that, but as I did not have a spare Castor at the time, I had attempted an initial repair.</p>
<p>

<p>
	You can clearly see the replaced dome, and the cybot leaning forward with no Castor. The robot in the background is an audio sensing based robot kit.</p>

<p>
	Here is an overview of the damage to the cybot - you will also note that one side of the line sensing part has gone. I am still not sure when that happened.</p>
<p>
	{img src=\"show_image.php?id=234&amp;thumb=1\" link=\"tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=234\"}</p>
<p>
	Now you can clearly see from the closeup where the pin has broken (I think my wife placed a few books on top of it). It is not a very clean break.<br />
	{img src=\"show_image.php?id=235&amp;thumb=1\" link=\"tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=235\"}</p>
<p>
	My first step was to open up my cybot and remove the pin.</p>
<p>
	{img src=\"show_image.php?id=236&amp;thumb=1\" link=\"tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=236\"}</p>
<p>
	Then I examined the pin, and the rest of the Castor:</p>
<p>
	{img src=\"show_image.php?id=237&amp;thumb=1\" link=\"tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=237\"}</p>
<p>
	It was clear that I could not use this without some serious repair. My first attempt at repair was to drive a pin(taken from a picture holder) and drive it into each to make a receptacle for it, and try to glue the two pieces together.</p>
<p>
	{img src=\"show_image.php?id=238&amp;thumb=1\" link=\"tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=238\"}<br />
	{img src=\"show_image.php?id=239&amp;thumb=1\" link=\"tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=239\"}</p>
<p>
	I did something at the time (this was a few years ago mind) that I would consider now a very foolish move, I did at the time too. I used the heat of a soldering iron and a set of pliers to drive the pins in. I did have it clamped, and I was using goggles - but a soldering iron is not quite designed or this - and the smell was awful. Before you ever try anything similar, please read my <a class=\"wiki wiki_page\" href=\"Robot+Building+Safety\" title=\"Building robots can be dangerous - tips to help your safety\">Robot Building Safety guide</a>.</p>
<p>
	This lasted for about 2 meters, before it just fell off, and no matter which glue I tried, at was not going to happen. So I disassembled the Castor, keeping the wheel and axle, and discarded the broken pieces. I went back to the drawing board, and came up with a <a class=\"wiki wiki_page\" href=\"Lego\" title=\"The best known construction toy\">Lego</a> substitute. I will post the rest of that when I dig out those photos - which were taken a few days later.</p>

The ship was as much an exploration of what I could do with MegaBloks as it was an expression. While I enjoyed it, I also concluded that they could not be relied upon to make solid connections, and was dismayed to find out by how much the plates mismatched. I really couldnt use them for anything serious in my robots. But hey, this particular model looked good and fun.

One thing that is clear from these shots is that colour scheme of the particular set was not unlike some of the early Transformers - putrid greens, purples and greys. However- the green works well for the engines on the rear of the ship - as you will later see.
{img src=show_image.php?id=242&thumb=1 tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=242}
However - the colour scheme makes the attempted greebles (sticky out bits on a ship to give it depth, detail and character) look a bit odd- given they are normally in greys and blacks.
{img src=show_image.php?id=243&thumb=1 tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=243}

Probably my favourite shot, if you will excuse the hand and the shower. The shot clearly shows the communications tower at the rear of the ship, and the formation of the middle two sets of purple curved panels - which I had intended both to represent something like the X-Impulse from StarFleet.

This is a rear shot of the ship. Note that the parts that look like old fashioned rockets are not intended to be the ships engines, but are to do with the weapons pods under the upper tail platform/wings. The green round areas are intended as the ships engines.

In this shot - you can see that the landing struts in the middle did not do very well on the landings - though they were a compromise when I couldnt use more of the red struts I used elsewhere.

	Last night I eventually saw the BBC\'s Dr Who Episode \"Dalek\" - where a single live Dalek has been stored in a collection by a rather devious control freak. It was worth it also to see Christopher Ecclestone\'s Doctor get really mad, and the Dalek telling the Doctor \"You would make a good Dalek\" - one of the best lines I have ever heard a Dalek say. Oddly enough, Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) actually felt sympathy for a Dalek, but you would have to watch the episode to see why.</p>
<p>
	Following this, I decided to have a look around for Dalek stuff on the net. Anyway I came across some rather interesting Dalek items.</p>
{SPLIT( fixedsize=\"n\")}


The first is a great following of people rendering Daleks with various 3D packages - a quick google search, and you will find many. In these, I came across the Spider Dalek - a prototype Dalek which will be some peoples worst nightmares combined!

This led me to the one remaining source of good renders of these - the Dalek Chess Project. Yes - some crazy people have started a project to make a battlechess game variant with Daleks as pieces. It uses the two factions (Rebel and Imperials) seen in Remembrance of the Daleks, and has the Dalek Spiders as Bishops.

For those of you who have never seen Battlechess, it is rather like the Harry Potter wizards chess - where the pieces brutally smash each other. In this version, they use their deadly death-rays and plungers to destroy each other.

	In the game, you play the lone Dalek, taking on the minions of the Van Stratten installation. It is a three-quarter perspective shoot-em-up, with the ability to upgrade the Dalek with various alien tech parts. A bit of strategy is involved, as you can only arm two of the tech bits at a time - and they have different functions like opening doors, elevating and shooting to name a few.</p>

","title": "Dalek Game","postId": 26}, {"FROM_UNIXTIME(created)": "2005-06-05 06:22:13","data": "I have been building a number of electronics items and projects recently - and once I have tested it thoroughly I will be posting my instructions on freeforming a diode rectifier bridge.

I treated myself to a nice new ((Soldering Iron)) this week - a temperature controlled model from Maplin as well as a set of universal test leads which have already come in handy. The new iron makes desoldering when salvaging components a great deal easier!

I have also decided to put together a signal generator, using a number of the velleman kits from maplin electronics. They have a simple signal generator kit (MK105), that can produce a Sine, Sawtooth, Triangle and Square wave signals at a fixed frequency. After building this (with my nice new soldering iron), I tested it, and the output is pretty stable - although it is at only around 200mv. So I then went and bought a universal 7W mono amplifier kit(K4001), which I will assemble, but I am new designing a container for them.

The nice thing is, as well as the ((PCB)) all components, and building instructions, they also come with full schematics - making it an easy job to hack them. One criticism of the K4001 is tht it fails to suggest goggles in the &quot;right tools&quot; section. They have obviously not read our ((Robot Bulding Safety|Safety guide)). It is worth having goggles when cutting objects - and this is more safe as well as effective than just pointing things away. Equally, PCB clamps, or &quot;helping hands&quot; clamps are highly recommended when soldering in components.

The idea of the container is to have the amplifier and the signal generator in one unit. Rather conveniently - the signal generator comes with a transparent plastic carry box. So I am going to place a 9v battery compartment inside it, and a cigar style 2.5mm power adaptor, then place a set of 3 speaker connectors (the terminal style) ones. The good thing about those is that thery are easy to connect with jump leads, and they have very clear polarity indicators. So I can still use the amp in standalone mode, I chose not to internally wire the generator to the amp, and expose the generator output, and the amp input as well as its output. This gives maximum flexibility.

I will then desolder the volume control trimpot from the signal generator, and replace it with a nice pot with a knob on the outside of the case. The choice of signals is currently set with a jumper, which I will replace with a 4 way dip switch or slider switch mounted on the case again. I also intend to see if i can introduce a method of altering the timing of the signals - both the frequency as well as the duty ratio.

This cost around Â£40 or Â£50 in total, which is significantly cheaper than a commercial function generator (which are easily a few hundred pounds), and much simpler (and safer) than using a PC sound card. 

I have been beavering away in ((CAD)) working out the location of the external components - I have got the internals worked out already. Once I have it completed, I will place the photographs on my site.","title": "Building a new device","postId": 27}, {"FROM_UNIXTIME(created)": "2005-06-06 10:23:32","data": "!Signal Generator build
Last night, I managed to get the cavities for the system drilled into the case that came with the velleman amp kit. It was a bit awkward - the material the case is made out of is very thin, and tends to split when drilled at all but the lowest speed setting. Equally, the material is very hard to clamp effectively so it either cant be held firmly, or it splits. 
I got there in the end though.

When designing it, I did not manage to find all the definitions for the socket parts, so I simply measured them up, and put holes to mount them in the CAD design. Once it all works, I will post the design here.

The DC power supply hole was an awkward shaped one - an elongated D with two small screw holes either side (a little too close). It required a fair amount of time with a Dremel, and then some elbow grease with a set of needle files to get it right. If you are going to attempt this yourself - be warned, that was the part I found most awkward. I am still debating on how I will mount the boards inside it.

!Freeform Diode Rectifier
If you look in [tiki-browse_gallery.php?galleryId=8|The Gallery], you will see I have taken photos of my construction of this. I am still yet to write it up, and may have to build and photograph another - as these photos really didnt work out at all. Unfortunately - I am really not very handy with a camera, and my camera\'s lense copes badly with closeup shots - although it does have a macro-mode setting.

I intend to thoroughly test it with the signal generator once I have built it - as we dont have the funds for a professional one, and it would be a good object to test with it to demonstrate both builds.

!Amiga
Meanwhile, I have decided to pull out my old Amiga 1200 computer, and try to recover all of the old software and disks, so I can (sadly) part with it before we move. After reading a number of boards, I am having a play with the Amiga Explorer software from Cloanto - I have to say, it really does the job. I think the installation over the serial line is very inventive, and works okay as long as you got your devices set up correctly in workbench, but tinkering with my Startup-Sequence and devs directory really took me back about 10 years! 

My Amiga has also developed a bad habit of crashing to a white screen after 20 or 30 minutes. I suspect one or more of the custom chips has had it, and is just about holding up until it overheats. I have bought another one off ebay for the job, and may have an interesting time seeing what I can salvage from my old one. I am going to be transcoding a large amount of my old Octamed music into a modern package - first a faithful note-for-note reproduction, then I will go on a bit of a remixing spree, modernising the styles and themes a little. I will post the details of hearing them on OrionRobots, but I will probably be using Last.fm to host them.","title": "More on the signal generator, and Amiga","postId": 28}, {"FROM_UNIXTIME(created)": "2006-07-08 04:44:19","data": "A recent story in the news talked of a homeless Chinese farmer who created robots, and was recently in the position were his house burnt down, he was riddled with debts, and the fantastic machines needed to be sold off.
{DIV(float=>right)}{img src=show_image.php?id=383 caption=\"Number Five\"}{DIV}
The 25 machines had been created in a way that OrionRobots truly admires, from pure ((Salvage Tips|salvage, junk and scrap)). Bits of wire, screws, bent pieces of metal, and other rubbish found at dumps was his main material. Even the batteries were old one. Just think what this man would have done with some ((Lego)) and an ((RCX)) or ((NXT)).

But these robots were not to be scoffed at, nope, they had purpose. When he sold them, one fetched 30,000 yuan, that\'s about Â£2500 to us. 

His top robot was called Number Five (although only coincidental to ((Johnny Five|Johnny Five from Short Circuit)) ), and is one meter tall. It is human shaped, and can walk, pour tea, change light bulbs and light cigarettes.

There is also Number Six (shame his naming conventions aren\'t as great as the bots themselves!), which is a monkey like robot with magnetic feet.

{DIV(float=>left)}{img src=show_image.php?id=384}{DIV}His transportation is every bit as crazy, with an eight legged walking machine capable of carrying two, or the robot pulled rickshaw. His number Eight has flexible fingers, and Wu\'s ultimate goal is to build a thinking human like robot. At present these robots are remote controlled.

Unfortunately, the debts, and property destruction have also been a result of his obsession. It was short circuiting robot that burned the family house to the ground in 1999. He has also had a battery explode in close proximity to him, leaving him with serious burns - in China there is no free health service, and this left him with medical bills. 

The builder, Wu Yulu, called them his sons or his children, and loved to build them and play with them. He built a bit of an emotional link with them, although anyone who had put much work into something may feel similar. He is a father of 2 real children, and I do wander how they feel about his robots being called his sons.

This man may have lost what he had, but it does not mean he cannot go and create more. Perhaps the man can be inspired to continue creating, and selling robots. It cant hurt to have another good innovator! If he could build enough robots to sell maybe one or two a year at that price, he would be considered a reasonably good earner in China, a better living than scratching around on an old village farm anyway. He plans to do so to pay off his debts.

Wu Yulu is a 44 year old man from Mawu Village in Eastern Beijing. He left school at the age of 14, and has had no former technical training. He started building robots nearly 15 years ago. His robtos have attracted international publicity, and even attention from government institutions. Hopefully, a robotics company will give this man employment.

<p>
	First: part replacements - I had a part in a set that broke, occasionally, it happens. I contacted Lego on their site to let them know, and they have sent out replacement parts. Is is already awesome, but what they did for 7 year old Luka is amazing Lego masterclass in customer service.</p>

<p>
	Second: Mindstorms ev3 - for those wandering if Lego are going to continue doing technic and Mindstorms robots, this is a resounding yes! The ev3 brings new sensors, great connectivity for mobile devices and is built on Linux making it the most hackable Lego kit yet. Granted it will be pricier than an rPi plus robot bits, but it shows Lego have heard the community and know what they\'re doing.</p>

","title": "Orionrobots Shop Goes Live","postId": 216}, {"FROM_UNIXTIME(created)": "2006-07-09 11:21:20","data": "In a recent story in Londons newspaper \"The Metro\", and also on New Scientist, a number of somewhat odd, and slightly painful experiments were conducted using Saharan desert ants to see if they used ((odometry)) - step counting or distance travelled measurement - to navigate. 

They think they have prooved it so too. Having previously made the conclusion that the position of the sun is used to determine direction, this is a relatively sophisticated navigation, for a group who were previously considered to wander randomly and only use pheremone scent trails to cover known ground. Robot builders have been using this for a long time, but it has always been considered an artifical system, something we made up so our simple ((microcontroller)) programs could cheaply estimate where the robot should be.

Now for the unpleasant bit - how it was done.  The scientists glued stilts on to some ants, which caused them to take larger strides, and so these ants overshot their destinations. Other ants had their legs shortened, and underestimated the distances. Control ants with normal legs made the destinations. The ants were allowed to learn the 10m route from a nest area to a source of food, and after becoming familiar with the route, were then caught at the end of the route in a sticky setting substance so they could have their legs lengthened or shortened by around 1mm.

The ants that overshot, or undershot would, upon reaching a certain distance (50% over and 50% under respectively) sweep back and forth looking for the destination they had expected to be there.

This tracking is likely to be hardwired more than concious - so the concept of ants being able to count is easily dismissed, although they might not be the only counting insect if they could. All cases of counting insects have been only known to do so as part of survival instincts.

Now an interesting peice of fall out is that this now makes odometry a valid approach for ((BEAM)) robots, if it is now considered a possible part of the sensory combination used by insects. Do flies or birds measure distance in terms of wingbeats? Or spiders measure how many \"pulls\" of thread have gone out?

A simple implementation could be a counter (like a 749x) that is set to increment by sensing each step until certain stimulous (light levels etc) are met, then is flipped so that it decrements, and when it reaches 0 it will stop, and then maybe wander out again somewhere else.

A more organic version could be that as the legs are driven forward, a capacitor is slow charged a little for each step, and then allowed to discharge slowly to a control transistor to send the bot scurrying in another direction.

Brickfest is a gathering of ((Lego)) fans to show and peruse creations by others from the community. There are presentations, workshops, as well as challenges and special events. It takes place over a weekend, and is based in the United States.

It has previously been held in Arlington, Virginia at George Masons University. As it has grown so much in size, this event, the 8th, will now be held at the Sheraton PremiÃ¨re at Tyson\'s Corner, Virginia.

On their site they have registration, as well as lists of the attendees. ((Lego)) fans can expect to see many of the different themes, including some that ((AFOL|AFOLs)) have come up with themselves. These will include the normal ones like Space and Town, as well as Technic and ((Mindstorms)), and there is likely to be a large ((GBC)) set up as well.

The event will be open to the general public (those not registered as exhibitors) during the Saturday and Sunday. On the Friday there will be a Media Day for journalists.

I have spent the last few weeks transferring data from it to my PC with help from Cloantos superb Amiga Explorer, Transdisk and a null modem cable.

At first - disaster. When i first powered up my Amiga -after 8 to 10 years in a dusty cupboard - I got nothing but a white screen. I power cycled it a couple of times, and it warmed up and booted. I decided then to clean and service it. Big huge dust bunnies, and a bit of a rust problem on the motherboard shield.

So I put it together, and then booted it to test that it still worked with things. It did - but had developed an annoying habit of dieing after around 20-30 mins and then booting only to a white screen for the next 40 mins. Also some of the keyboard was duff - the Left Amiga key didnt work, the last row of the numeric keyboard was stuffed as well. Very upset - I then went an bought another Amiga on ebay. 

While I waited for it to arrive- I had to do whatever work in 40 minutes. Since I dont have room for a monitor, and TV, I started using my TV Amazing box - which means I had to switch between Amiga and PC. 

The first real task was to get Amiga Explorer running. This should be relatively painless, only I had a few small problems with my setup - the main one being that the serial device was not (for some reason) installed on the HDD installation of workbench, and KingCON (an AmigaDOS extension to add scroll bars and other UI tweaks to the console) remapped the ser: interface.

Once this was sorted - I hit my 20 minute limit(this became a regular annoyance until the new one arrived). When it was back up, I then installed the Amiga portion of Amiga Explorer. It installs over the serial cable - you dont need any floppy swapping - which is really useful as a PC wont read/write Amiga floppies, the Amiga floppy drive only reads double densities (no good for a couple of meg), and my PC has no floppy drive any more anyway.

It is actually surprisingly easy to do, and to use - although I had very little luck trying to grab ADF\'s of disks directly with Amiga explorer- I would either run out of my time limit (20 minutes remember), or it would simply fail the conection. Also - 20 minutes was not enought to transfer the Hard Disk contents (only a mere 20Mb) over the slow serial connection.

So - I used the Amiga to copy as much of my own work as I could to the HDD, so I didnt need the floppies for that. I used transdisk to generate ADFs of Non AmigaDOS floppies.

Unfortunately - I soon had to dig out QuarterBack tools and DiskSalv - many of the disks had a few block errors, and some refused to read at all. I got as much as I could.

Ironically - the Amiga from ebay only arrived after I had sucessfully - and painstakingly transferred everything to my PC! The new Amiga had a floppy drive problem, so I moved mine accross, along with the HDD. Soak tested it running an Octamed looping song for around 8 hours with no crashes! Yay.

I cleaned and serviced the new one - and its [http://orionrobots.co.uk/tiki-view_forum_thread.php?comments_parentId=157&topics_sort_mode=commentDate_desc&forumId=6|for sale with all the enhancements].

Its been a blast, and I loved my Amiga, but it is time to say a teary goodbye and move on. The old one that crashes - is now consigned to silicon heaven. The duff floppy drive, motherboard and other PCBS will be ((Salvage Tips|Salvaged)). The Workbench 3.0 ROMs kept (I will consider any offers). The plastic case is clean, but I may just have to trash it - again I will consider any offers first(even if they only cover postage!). The keyboard is a bit useless - and only good for the bin.

On another note - I have now finished all the building and testing of the Signal Generator, and the Freeform Diode bridge, and will write them up, along with any snags just as soon as I have time. At the moment - everything is geared towards the move. It looks like we are going at the end of june/early july.","title": "Amiga transfer finally over","postId": 29}, {"FROM_UNIXTIME(created)": "2006-07-22 03:15:08","data": "MRAM - Magnetic RAM has now started to be commercially produced by ~np~FreeScale~/np~. It is a non volatile memory, which is fast, has relatively low power consumption, and may become the replacement for Hard Disks.  It has been the holy grail of a group of memory chip designers throughout the 1990s and 2000s. 

For a robot builder, this means being able to increase the storage on robots by a great deal, without the risk of having to deal with shocks, a common reason for not using a hard-disk based storage system in a robot. 

((MRAM)) is not without its own problems. Being magnetically based (as are Hard Disks), it will probably be needed to be kept at some distance from any motors or magnetic sources in a robot.

Its advantage over normal flash memory, including ((NAND)) based flash, is that it has a massive number of rewrites, comparable with a hard disk, and not the much lower numbers of writes that is expected from a normal ((flash memory)). 

!!Will this see a new wave of ((MicroController|MicroControllers))?

Will vendors release their controller lines with increased memory? Possibly, but that massively depends on the ability to produce it cheaply, and the ability to produce it with the same fabrication hardware. Until fabrication (that is chip manufacturing) techniques allow the deposition of MRAM along with a MicroController on the same bit of silicon, it is unlikely. Because of the demand that the mobile device market would place, there will probably be massive efforts to unify the manufacture, so ((SoC)) systems could use the technology.

However, this is all different for ((SBC|SBC\'s)) and MicroController development/hobbyist boards, which may carry the chip.

Amazingly, the ~np~H-Racer~/np~ sells at the price of just $80, including a solar power refuelling station. 

Now for a long time now, I have talked about the advances that ((fuel cell)) technology may bring to robotics, and this kit may be one to start harvesting parts to create such things.  

Sadly, it only runs for 4 minutes on a full cell, however, maybe combined with very low power ((BEAM Robots|BEAM)) concepts, maybe a great deal more could be gained from it,  although it is not clear how much control one can have over the discharge rate of the cell at this point.

Who knows what the hobbyist community would do with it once they get their hands on such a thing. Fitting the station with a beacon and a docking mechanism could allow the robot to find its own charger, as other battery powered ones do.

Horizon is also selling $50 education fuel cell kits, and hopes to place them in phones and ((PDA|PDAs)) at some stage in the future.

While there was the fantastic news yesterday that we won the 2012 Olympics, we have been struck this morning, by the devastating news of bombs in Central London.

First - I want to make sure readers, and those who know me know that I was not affected - in fact, I was taking the day off so I can pack for our move to Northolt.

Second - I want to pay my respects for the dead and injured - and also voice my absolute CONTEMPT for the cowards who carried out the act. You know who you are, and your act only demonstrates that you are morons who know only violence - evolve or get lost idiots!

This is Orion, Danny, Signing off for today. Between this, and the move, I am not likely to be posting until at least monday.

Orion","title": "Breaking big news for London","postId": 30}, {"FROM_UNIXTIME(created)": "2005-07-13 08:49:20","data": "Hi all.
I am now currently mostly offline at the moment. Ihave now moved to our new place - whew. What a job. Between the unpleasant events of last week - which nearly lead to my lift pulling out, and the actual move as well as the fact that it has been a blisteringly hot couple of days - I have had a full on weekend.

The annoying thing is that it is at least a week before I get broadband internet access at home. Net cafes have woefully inadequate machines - although it did highlight how difficult my website can be to use on very low-res computers.

I have also noted that the recent update to the wiki software has left the title bars in the blogs unreadable - I will be messing about with the CSS for this when I get a chance - thats a promise!

The upshot of all of this, is in my new place, I now have a dedicated study room - so thats a mini-workshop at home for when I have smaller stuff to do. It means that once net access is restored - I will be able to get more productivity. I will also be working on my task management app - which will be first previewed here - being of the coder/inventor mindset - when I really cannot find a tool that does what I want - I write my own!

Anyway - OrionRobots is about to shift into a new phase, where I will be getting ivolved in lots of youth events, including kids birthdays, after-school and groups like scouts, brownies and Woodcraft. Please contact me - using the [tiki-contact.php|Contact Us] page, if you would like to book an event - these are all challenge based, mostly using ((Lego)) and similar to some of the content seen in the ((East Finchley Robotics Club)).

Orion","title": "Mostly offline, Moving, New Study, Task Management and Birthdays","postId": 31}, {"FROM_UNIXTIME(created)": "2006-07-14 02:55:36","data": "It seems that some crazy group of people have been opening their fingers (OUCH!) and embedding magnets under their skin. This allows them to sense metal running under walls, detect motor movements and ((AC)) current and many other things.

However, cutting open skin sounds very dodgy to me, and as well as being unnecessarily painful, has resulted in bits of magnet breaking off and embedding themselves further into the finger, infection, and loss of fingertip sensitivity. Thats just not good!

Now, on [http://zovirl.com/2006/07/09/magnetic-sense/|Mark Ivey\'s blog], he recounted finding a magnet and gluing it to his fingertips with wood glue (and considered super glue!). Which while being much less painful still sounds a bit too much.

So my own suggestion is why not embed them into a set of gloves? The cheapest way would be to buy a pair of Marigolds (kitchen rubber gloves) that fit you, and then glue the magnet to the inside of these. The disadvantage is that the pull may not be quite as detectable, and also that the gloves will make your hands more clumsy.

So my more expensive, and interesting solution, is to make latex finger sheaths, and put bits of ((Neodymium)) magnet into them.

I think I am going to build some (the simple Marigold version) this weekend. It if works, I will add it to my list of ((Robot Tools|tools)) in the wiki.

At the moment, things on the OrionRobots website have been moving rather slowly. I have had limited time to do any editorial - as I have been assembling furniture, and sorting everything out. And also, we still do not have the internet sorted out at home - so I am now maintaining the site from \'net cafes and the local library. Hopefully - normal service will be resumed in a week or so. I have to say though, seeing my website from these computers has made me seriously consider the stylesheet setup. Some of them had very small screens, low resolution and older browsers.

!Events in London
This weeks recurring events in London have also hampered certain efforts - I was meant to collect a real signal generator, but the tube lines were restricted and I couldn\'t get there. I would like to say that OrionRobots still has the victims of these events in mind, and still wholly condemns the perpetrators of these acts. Whatever they were intended to achieve, we are not scared. We are going about our daily business, and London will not be subdued. I remember the Hammersmith Bridge bombing, I remember a number of IRA events - and this may be different in tactics, but to us it is nothing new. I am glad that instead of reactionary knee-jerks, that the government and Muslim groups are working together to route out the extremists.

!Signal Generator
Although my homebrew signal generator/amp combination is fine for some work, it is limited at the moment to having only one frequency, and until I find (or buy) the right kind of switch, then I still have to open it up to change the waveform type. Also - I have the 10uF capacitors for taking off the DC offset on the outside - I may try and integrate those. I attached the power switch with hot glue - as is most of the items in the box. However - that glue has worn off, and the switch now dangles inside it. I may have to use a more permanent glue, or find the right sized bolts for it. The professional one I am expecting to collect will make work easier though.

!DorkbotLondon
This week I attended a rather interesting meeting/forum in London, known as DorkBotLondon, a spin off of a New York event. It is a gathering of technologists, programmers, hackers, tinkerers and geeks, to show off electronic art presentations and items. It is a very freeform event with &quot;OpenDork&quot; presentations on Work In Progress projects, and live demonstrations of items. There was also beer and cakes. I took a few photos of one of the presentations, and once I find a good place to upload them, I will put them on a gallery here.

The event I went to included a man who had created a music/video instrument with a wireless joypad, a wireless camera/microphone, and a Laptop, the software on the laptop used the light in the image to control the video, and feedback/phasing on the mic to control the audio. The joypad controls were used to rotate and shape parameters for the system. There was an interesting presentation of SMS controlled chandeliers, and textile mp3 players for joggers, as well as a guy who was talking of an event where sensors were attached to a steam engine to create a music/video show - sadly - he did not have enough footage to give any depth to that presentation.

[http://orionrobots.co.uk/tiki-directory_redirect.php?siteId=138|DorkBotLondon Website]

While there, I met with many people interested in doing electronic projects, gadgets and gizmos, some of whom I will probably link up with further to try and take them on as projects. I will post here if anything like that develops.

!New Poll
Finally, I would like today to bring your attention to a new poll (yes that\'s it in the bottom right!) we have running, on the use of robotics in education. Please can we get some answers - as we have only had two votes, and I know for a fact that there are more people than that reading. If you think there are other poll questions we should ask, post a comment and let me know!

This ever changing image was the visual output of the joypad instrument. It was quite interesting - but may have been more so in a more vibrant light setup. A dark/dusty warehouse (the venue this time) had far from optimal conditions. However daylight, and possibly nightclubs with exotic lighting rigs may give the system enough stimulus to give more interesting results. The actual pad was passed around the audience, who played with the parameters, and manipulated it, with the occasional cry of &quot;Don\'t press that button!&quot; from the creator. The pad itself was simply a wireless game pad, with a wireless camera/mic strapped on with what looked like duct tape - the real genius was in the software, which although a little temperamental, was quite innovative.

We only saw a still slide of this chandelier. It was made with Swarovski crystals with embedded LED\'s, and a set of PIC\'s controlling LED matrices from above. You would text a message to a number, and the message would scroll down the spiral of the chandelier. It was tested at an evening do, and apparently the text messages got more interesting as the night wore on!

I was too interested in the content of the rest of the creators presentation that I did not get any more shots, but there were flexible displays, LED image matrix chandeliers controlled by a bluetooth PDA, clothing embedded music players and fitness monitors, a fitness monitor/mp3 player that automatically uploaded stats to a computer, a highly souped up VW Golf and loads of other potential interesting projects.

I did not get any photos of the Steam Driven presentation, as nothing really leapt out as worth capturing, although I regretted not getting a shot of the streetmap.org guys. The Steam Driven guy started with a system which could use images from a few hundred Google hits (200 from one topic, 1 hundred from another, or something similar) to create a montage of images - when used with radio stations creates an amusing or topical audio/visual display. We were shown George Bush, and Badgers. It would at very least make a very amusing and dynamic screen-saver.

However, before I even managed the first of the listed models, I got inspired, and created myself a lighthouse and steamer (the movie Titanic was on at the time). Remember - all of the thumbnails are clickable:

{img src=show_image.php?id=288&amp;thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=288}{img src=show_image.php?id=289&amp;thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=289}{img src=show_image.php?id=291&amp;thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=291}{img src=show_image.php?id=292&amp;thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=292}{img src=show_image.php?id=295&amp;thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=295 description=extreme closeup}

I then spotted my Geoff Wayne &quot;War Of The Worlds&quot; CD, and was furthar inspired. This was, after all, a mech set. I had also recently seen a tripod posting on ((Lugnet)) mecha - so I decided to have a go.

I built my own interpretation of the fighting machines as described by HG Wells:

{img src=show_image.php?id=286&amp;thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=286}

I then modifed the boat into something like the ThunderChild - a steamboat/gunship depicted on the musicals cover, fighting a hopeless battle with the martian war machines:

{img src=show_image.php?id=284&amp;thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=284}

I then took some mobile phone shots of them together - a diorama if you like:

Then I had an attempt at the fall of the ThunderChild (a major scene in the musical version) - the orange grill is meant to be melting metal.

{img src=show_image.php?id=284&amp;thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=282}{img src=show_image.php?id=284&amp;thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=287}

At this point, I decided to go all out, and get out the real digital camera. I put together a polystyrene foam backing - that I hoped would make for a neutral background. I then starting building some scenery for the scene.

I built a microscale ((Lego)) London, including Big Ben, Westminster, and Tower Bridge, as well as a ((Lego)) equivalent of cardboard ctout distant burning buildings.

Here I tried to get perspective from foot to head of the martian machine:

This was a straight on shot - face to face with the war machine
{img src=show_image.php?id=300&amp;thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=300}

Finally - as I was feeling a little proud of my creation, and wanted a bit of fun, I used the Gnu Image Manipulation Tool (the GIMP) to &quot;photoshop&quot; a few of the images:

{img src=show_image.php?id=299&amp;thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=299}

I may try at some point to put together CAD models of these, but unfortunately, mnay of the parts used in the whole scene are simply not available in LDraw yet.

It looks to the casual observer like a young Japanese woman, but in fact is a sophisticated robot with synthetic skin. 

It is currently limited to sitting down, and the illusion of being human cannot be sustained when you interact at length with it - but these robots are getting closer to the mark.

This is a brilliant development. I am sure there are those that fear it could be the step toward worlds like that of ((Blade Runner)) and ((The Terminator)), but I think at this point, replicant robots are merely playthings, and me be the butlers of tomorrow. I can see them being much more the role of Commander Data than some of the darker possibilities.

The creator of this robot is Professor Hiroshi Ishiguro of Osaka University, who beleives one day robots really will be able to pass for humans. At this point though, an ((AI)) needs to pass the ((Turing Test)) first - something I dont think will happen until we really create systems which can data mine, have real world senses, context sense like ((SHRDLU)) as well as decent vocabulary and grammar. The robot would also (like this one, ((Cog)) and ((Kismet)) ) need to be able to make and maintain eye contact, and be able to draw context on is surroundings, and the eye movements of its talking partner. 

While we are gaining ground, we are still a long way from having a natural conversation with a robot.

I have been making many small and useful improvements to the site. First - I have create two tikiwiki mods which are now distributed on the articals section. They are all installable tiki mods, and I still have some work to do on a third item before its distributed.

The first is a [tiki-read_article.php?articleId=8|technorati plugin] which allows tikiwiki users to create technorati tags inside their wiki.

The second is a [tiki-read_article.php?articleId=8|Googlebar module] which allows other tikiwiki sites to host google ads as a module like I do.

The third (which will be uploaded shortly) is a googlebar plugin for wikipages, which allows placement of googlebars in content.

I use googlebar ads as they are highly context sensitive, and quite often give useful links to very relevant companies. You will note that I do not have any big top banners or big flash based ads, and I have (so far) managed to avoid the evils of certain ringtone ads.

I have also discovered the wiki draw feature, which uses JGraphPad to put editable drawings in the wiki, and have been converting some of the diagrams on the site to that format. I spent a bit of time today updating the version 3 JGraphPad shipped with tikiwiki to a newer version 5.4.0. The latest is 5.6, but since I cannot find a signed version, I will stick to 5.4. I did spend a bit of time looking into signing one myself - maybe later.

I also attended another dorkbotlondon meeting - it is quite an interesting group of techies, hackers and electronic artists, although a bit of a mixed bag. This time I found out about [http://www.holyshallot.com|Holy Shallot] - an associative database of cooking ingredients.

I just wanted to alert any ((lego)) builders in the Uk, that there is now an excellent deal on a huge bucket of ((lego)) at Argos at the moment. Â£19.99 for 1500 peices - all basic bricks and slopes, is fantastic, and it comes in stackable sturdy box - which is excellent for storing Lego. I went and bought one as soon as I could.

I have also been doing a lot of house related DIY, self assembly furniture and such. I was able to use my skill to add sidelamp and charger socket functionality to our overbed fitment - but I think I have done enough for now.

I have also updated the information on the [tiki-contact.php|Contact] page with the new details - something which I have left a little too long.","title": "Busy and Building","postId": 36}, {"FROM_UNIXTIME(created)": "2005-10-06 05:30:15","data": "I have been recently updating all of the older OrionRobots wiki pages, adding new content and fixing old spelling errors. I now intend to resurrect the spell checker, and attempt to try and get it incorporated into the comment/forum and blog posts as well as the basic wiki pages.

I have still only partially succeeded in adding tool to put Technorati submit buttons on article or blog posts, and so this is not ready for roll out.

I am also working on a replacement for the draw application- so expect to see a lot of the diagrams here being replaced with better ones eventually.

Beyond that I have also been brushing up my ((Salvage Tips|salvage)) skills with a bunch of circuit boards and old bits I recovered from Freecycle. I found a technique using a shaving mirror - if I clamp a board vertically, and place it so the solder side is facing me, and the component side is facing the mirror - then it is fairly easy to see what I am doing and pull out components with a good set of narrow pliers while desoldering connections. 

While building in the new flat, I realised that I needed to improve the ventilation conditions, and built an extraction fan system based on a PC fan with the sides rounded off (using a set of files), a 12v power supply,half a coke bottle, and an old vacuum cleaner tube. it is not particularly strong, and I am thinking of doubling up the fan with another, but it does help in sucking away the fumes from desoldering.

I also observed that with some boards they sometimes use hot glue to keep cables in place - and the best way to remove it is to use pliers to tug sharply at the middle of the glue blob - i.e. if its along a ribbon cable, then grab the middle and pull - it comes away in one piece normally. Pulling at the sides just tends to give you plier shaped bites from those sides - tedious.

I also have found a kit of soldering tools at a pound shop which are almost like a set of dentists instruments - they have wicked curved hooks, points, brushes etc... - and they are very useful. the hooks are perfect for getting under component legs and pulling them away, and also scraping/chipping away the wax that some board manufacturers set around some components. I suspect I have gained a few new things to be adding to the ((Salvage Tips)) area of the website.

((Salvage Tips|Salvaging)) is still tough work and I am glad I have finished for a while.

OrionRobots has now also acquired a scanner - so I may scan in some older sketches, which will eventually be replaced when the new drawing application is sorted.

It is a very forgiving language to program in, and the kind where 5 lines of ((Ruby)) can do what may take 500 lines of ((Java)) or ((C Language|C)) code.

Now some clever NXT\'er (is that a word?), Tony Buser, has now put together a Ruby module for communicating with the ((NXT)) via ((bluetooth)). This control set up is in a kind of macromode, where the PC is using bluetooth to read sensors, and set actuators, but may also be adapted just to provide prompts to a program on the machine. It is not however, a Ruby interpreter that runs on the ((NXT)). It is, in many ways, a similar setup to ((MSRS)).

It runs nicely in OSX, and probably Linux, once you have paired your NXT and setup a bluetooth serial port connection in /dev. I cannot say what its compatibility in Windows would be like, as although Ruby runs in Windows, the serial port and bluetooth may be much harder to deal with. Windows does not have any structure equivalent to /dev.

I am not yet sure of how Tony intends to license the project going forward, but I will be watching this one with interest. Its definitely usable, although there are a few things that may need to happen before prime time, including documentation.

With their vehicle, Stanley, based upon a Volkswagen Touareg, they took the race in 7 hours and 28 minutes. Not bad considering how much of a challenge the 212 Km course is, and the best attempts last year barely made it off the start line.

\'\'Stanley\'\', the vehicle in question had already shown its mettle when it managed to drive 200 miles unaided in the Arizona desert in testing. And considering they were a newcomer, its a fantastic result.

{TAGS()}robotics RCX lego NXT mindstorms{TAGS}","title": "2nd International LEGO MINDSTORMS Competition","postId": 93}, {"FROM_UNIXTIME(created)": "2006-06-28 14:51:28","data": "Since the [http://orionrobots.co.uk/tiki-view_blog_post.php?blogId=1&postId=92|MSRS Announcement], the robotics community have been keeping close watch on MS. Because of the presence MS has, much of the commentary is cynicism.

There have been objections on the grounds of crashing/blue-screen robots, robot security, and also just the general objection about MS muscling in on what was previously seen as safe ground.

!!Romancing the community
Microsoft are at this point actively trying to establish a different corporate image, and foster a little of the community goodwill that is so readily given to open source products. With their [http://www.microsoft.com/resources/sharedsource/|Shared Source] initiative, they allow licensed users to view their source. This may give them the ability to spot security flaws, and potential bugs then, and report those to MS, with a community interaction that is currently only available to other projects. As far as I can tell, MSRS is not yet in this program, but MS could be persuaded that it would be in their interest to, especially when involving the academic or hobbyist communities. 

Robot builders tend to be among the more technically minded, and therefore a niche group who are even more likely to use Linux than others. This may be incentive enough for MS to ensure this is in their shared source program, and bring some people back.

!!Stability and Reliability
{DIV(width=>20%, float=right)}^-=Windows Stability=-
MS still retain compatibility fixes in Windows to stabilise 3rd party software from 1997 and earlier. A classic case is memory being freed and then written to, a situation that is almost guaranteed to cause instability. In older versions of Windows, the freed memory was less likely to be reused immediately, and now, for certain pieces of software, the freed memory is actually kept aside for a while.
^{DIV}This would also improve the perception of security and reliability, as if something does crash, with the underlying source available, you have a chance of tracking it down better. Microsoft are also, following some fairly bad windows press, focusing on both issues a great deal, and this new platform may not have to carry around the excess legacy baggage that Windows still has. 

Without this baggage, the feeling of instability and bloat will not be so present. However, there are questions about how appropriate it is trying to adopt server/web communication technology like XML and REST to embedded systems which may not have the processing power, bandwidth or memory to cope with them. This bloat at present is only likely to occur on the PC side of the system, again coming back to the fact that it is not actually expected to run on the ((microcontroller)) itself.

!!Muscling In
We have to still bear in mind the fact that this stuff does not currently run on the ((microcontroller|microcontrollers)) themselves, but on a connected PC. Considering that ((Open Source)) software already has a firm foothold here, and chip vendors like Microchip produce their own systems, Microsoft would have to go along way to \"Muscle in\" here.

By bringing more people into the community by actively engaging schools, there is every possibility that some of those people will discover the ((Open Source)) routes as well. So increasing the market size may have a positive affect on the whole system.

!!A matter of choice
\"I\'m not going to buy that!\" - then don\'t. There are plenty of other proprietary and open source alternatives, and it really is a matter of choice. If MS do look like they are going to dominate the scene and wipe out all the choice, put effort into improving a community project (for example ((SDCC)) or ((BrickOS)) ) - making them better will keep the balance even.

!!Standardisation
On these small devices, most communication and data storage is still based on tight binary formats. At this point in the development of robotics, standardisation may only complicate what are still simple systems. 

However, as they grow in capability and complexity, which will be inevitable, then adopting open standards will prevent robotics getting into situations that abound on the desktop, where choice is prevented by having proprietary file formats and communication systems. It will also speed up development time, as there is no point reinventing the wheel.

!!My own perspective
My personal view is that a balanced \"ecosystem\" of robotic programming, simulation and development kits will push things forward. The kind of complacency a monopoly (even from the ((Open Source)) world) fosters can only stifle development. From this perspective, it may become apparent that interoperability is absolutely essential here. 

What MS are doing right now is adding choice to a developing market - which for now cannot be a bad thing. 

That is not to say I trust MS, and I do know what they have been up to in the past. Those who know me, know that I use a Linux desktop, and generally use Firefox. How it will work out in the long term is anybodies guess.

After events at the NQE where they prepared, and qualified for the event, and last years Grand Challenge, the teams had to be sure either robot was prepared for anything. This was it - the big moment where their robot was out in the world, and on its own!

{DIV(float=right, width=20%)}{img src=show_image.php?id=321 width=100% link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=321}{DIV}
The Stanford University team (the victors) skipper Sebastian Thrun was obviously quietly confident when he declined to comment on the performance of Stanley (pictured right) in the 200 mile prerace tests of their own devising across the Arizona desert. 

The vehicles had already endured a gruelling week of qualifying rounds, shorter trips with various obstacles including traffic cones, hay bales and car wrecks. These included desert, urban and also raceway terrain. This was to whittle down the original 118 entries down to 40 semifinalists, then the 23 finalists for the main event. 20 were actually chosen, then the judges put through an additional 3.

Soon Cornell suffered a disappointing loss as their vehicle, a light military model, was unable to cross a bridge only 20 miles in. An engineer in the team drearily admitted that they are still trying to figure out what went wrong.

Even though they didn\'t win, it was heartening to see even a young school team \'\'Road Warriors\'\' (Palos Verdes High School, California) compete with their fabulously titled \'\'Doom Buggy\'\'.

15 of the 23 contenders did not finish the race, though they all got further than the Carnegie Mellon University entry \'\'Sandstorm\'\' (a Humvee) did last year. This year \'\'Sandstorm\'\', back and improved, finished third. When \'\'Stanley\'\' finished, four other racers were still on the track. There is a little complexity in the race finish calculations, because of staggered start times, which have to be taken into account when considering the quickest finish.

I wander how Stanford Racing are going to use the $2 million?

These guys build all kinds of stuff, and I strongly recommend you go out and read at least one. It is published by O\'Reilly, who are also known for some pretty good computer books, like the Nutshell series.

Bre Pettis, one of the regular builders from the Make team, this week used a ((VEX)) kit to build a Kite Aerial Photography rig. Allowing him to fly the machine, and take snapshots from a height. This cool little rig took more than one attempt, with him using a pillar drill (or drill press) to drill aluminium parts to replace the VEX ones and lighten the overall device. The camera could be tilted up or down, and panned left or right.

Bre did however get his fingers burned using the pillar drill, and made no mention of goggles, so please any one trying to do this at home, read ((Robot Building Safety)) first.

For more - have a look at the site, where they have video as well as some more background.

What I would like to try is this with a wireless camera that can be powered from a small 9v cell, and then use a regulator with the VEX microcontroller so they both run of the same cell. Not only would the thing be lighter and smaller, but you could then have full video and feedback. The only issue would be that the resolution would be much lower than having a still camera on board.

I suspect we may see similar things with the ((NXT)), possibly using ((bluetooth)) with a mobile phone to get the pictures taken, thus saving on motorised actuation. However, the ABS plastic may turn out heavier than the aluminium version.

IREX is the Earths largest robot show. It has been held alternate years since 1973, and is organised by ((JARA)) (The Japan Robot Association). 
!Tokyo International Robot Exhibition 2005
Unfortunately we were not able to attend the 2005 show in person. It was held in the Tokyo International Exhibition Centre in Ariake for four days from 30th November to Saturday 3rd December. Showcasing 192 groups (152 private companies, and 40 organizations), the show had a huge range of different kinds of robots. 

This year show an increasing trend of robots beginning to move into the service industry and emergency services. However - also because of poor economic conditions in Japan, industrial robots are being made faster, cheaper and able to perform more tasks. This competes with low cost manual production in China, and may increase product quality as well.

Here is a small selection of them.

!!Other Robots
{DL(new_sep=>true)}
HAL~:~This is an interestingly named ((exosuit)). Its name is an acronym for Hybrid Assistive Limb, and it was created by Tsukuba University - I think there may have been some tongue in cheek thought to the homicidal space odysseys computer. This friendlier robot detects muscle movements through skin electrical variances and responds, allowing powerful lifting. It can be used to help the elderly or physically challenged with stairs and movement.
Real Life Pacman~:~A huge pacman game was created by Bandai and Namco - more information here [http://gadgets.elliottback.com/2005/11/30/real-life-pac-man/|Cute  & Adorable Gadgets - Real Life PacMan] and at [http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2005/12/pacbot_terrorizes_irex_2005.php|GameSetWatch - Pac-Bot terrorizes IREX 2005].
KHR-1~:~The KHR-1 robots from Kondo Kagaku are a small kit system with many servos, linked to a computer. At IREX, it was showing off its supple abilities and balancing skills. The kit can be purchased for around Â£605 (126,000 yen).
SPC-003~:~A direct competitor (although with a higher price point) to the KHR-1 was the SPC-003. This bot, weighing it at just over 4 Kgs came with PC based motion simulators. However - they are unlikely to be too popular over here at nearly 4 grand sterling!

This years DARPA Urban Challenge is perhaps the most interesting of them.

On the heels of the previous successful ((DARPA Grand Challenge)) the Urban Challenge adds the complication of driving through complex urban routes. This meant having skills to deal safely with other road users. The \"Tartan Racing\" team from Carnegie Mellon University won with with \"Boss\". Tartan Racing had a 20 minute lead based on calculated starting times and official stoppage time. The earlier title holders Stanford University followed with \"Junior\" in second place. Victor Tango\'s \"Odin\" from Virginia Tech came in third.

Carnegie Mellon were awarded $2 million, Stanford University received a $1 million price for coming second place and VT took an award of $500k. Given the laser and Ultrasonic rangefinders, GPS, Cameras, automatic controllers, steering systems, computer workstations and other kit put on board each car to get them functioning, as well as the expertise it takes in getting all of it together, these kind of prizes are well earned.

The three winning teams came from a short-list of 6 cars that actually completed the event. 11 cars were actually able to start the event, with  2 cars stopping, 1 car hitting a building (not at speed), and later another 2 cars due to bad driving and collisions were taken out of the race.

What is remarkable is the technology in the finishing cars drove them legally and safely, and this criteria was required along with finishing times to have any chance of being considered a winner. The event was more than a race, and included parking manoeuvres as well as other challenges. Cars needed to indicate, keep their speed sensible (under 30mph), avoid collisions, stay on the road, behave correctly at traffic junctions and follow a course with plenty of turns.

","title": "DARPA Urban Challenge","postId": 160}, {"FROM_UNIXTIME(created)": "2007-11-25 15:20:00","data": "!Background
Since I have mentioned A-Life, and genetic algorithms a few times, I decided to make a simple demonstration model. It is based upon a couple of clips I saw on you tube, who must take some credit for this.

I also admit to finding a rather neat Javascript library, and simply wanting to try it out. This was the result. I have quite simply called it \"Evolution\".

!Starting out
The example has only been tested in Firefox and IE, could Opera users let me know how they do?

You then want to open the following link in a new tab or window:
[/orion_apps/evolution/evolving.html|Evolution App]

You will now see an application with a large canvas, a toolbar at the top, a sidebar with some parameters, and a bottom area with a log message stating that the logger was initialised.

The log area gives text messages with detail on what is happening, but the main event will be in the canvas. Lets start by explaining what will happen, then putting some configuration values in.

The maximum population size is currently 100. Anything larger will not be rendered by the browser yet. 

What you will be doing is a simulation, albeit a very crude one, of evolving creatures from a base point, to match their environment. They all have an RGB colour value, which is represented by three 8-bit numbers, and these bits are the genotype - that is, the information about the individuals characteristics. These genotypes are translated to actual colours, which will be rendered on the screen.

The environment they are in is a background colour. The further they are from this colour, the more likely they are to be \"eaten\" by an imaginary predator. The predator chooses prey at random, but it is most likely to go for the easiest target. After the predator, and some bad luck, have culled the population, the remaining number will then be selected for breeding to create the next generation. This is entirely random, and the selection of genes from the breeders is random, along with a small mutation factor which may alter one of the genes. A mutation is basically a single bit-flip.

The intention is that when the simulation is running, the population will generally drift towards the background colour as those less suited to the environment tend to be less lucky than those closer to it.

I suggest setting the mutation rate to about 0.02. Any larger, and the mutations will be too many to keep it consistent, too small and it will take a hugely long time to get there (considering it is about 2/3 minutes per generation).

Set the RGB background colour to any colour you like - some will be closer to the default starting creature colour, and some further.

I suggest setting the unlucky factor to about 20. Set the predatory factor to about 40. That means that in any generation, 60% of the population will die or be eaten.

You are now ready to start the simulation. Press the \"init\" button on the toolbar, and you should see the generation rendered as a bunch of boxes against a coloured background. The boxes are the population, and the background is their environment.

!Stepping
Now is where the fun starts - press the \"Step\" button.
You will now see 20 of the population randomly chosen as the \"unlucky\" deaths, they will fade away as the predators then ravage 40 individuals, who also fade. Since they are all the same colour at this point, there is no real selection going on.

The remaining population turn blue - they are now selected to breed. Then pairs of individuals will flash as they become a breeding pair. An individual may become very lucky, and breed many times, while another will be unlucky and may not get to breed at all. An individual may breed with another, or with itself. 

At the end of that phase, the environment is now populated with a completely new generation. Many individuals will be the same as before, but one or two will have a different colour. 

Press \"step\" again. This time, the colours will noticeably be sorted between the unlucky and predatory phase, so those more suitable will be at the bottom right of the screen. It is clear the predator favours those at the top left. Step a few times, and after about 5-7 generations, you should start to see them approaching the background colour.

Now try a few of your own parameters - try smaller populations (sorry it cannot yet go above 100), try different predatory and unlucky factors (they should add up to less than 100 between them), and then press \"init\" to apply the parameters. You can then experiment to see the effects of different settings.

!What is this good for?
This is a very, very simple demonstration of a genetic algorithm. But they can be used as a way to find unusual solutions to a problem. Imagine a complex mathematical problem - including some of those that are known to be difficult for neural net learning rules to deal with, and this method may be able to find a solution where they cannot.

This makes it very effective, given preferences of better and more economical solutions, to find neat solutions. Arm the phenotype with the ability to run as some sandbox program code, and you can literally grow programs.

However - there are a couple of warnings with GA\'s as problem solvers.

The first is that the solutions they come up with are not that likely to be human readable. Expect spaghetti code, and craziness like reusing the same piece of memory in 6 completely different but beneficially and incidentally related ways. The code will solve the problem, but not really in the way you would expect.

The second issue is that you have to be careful with the environment and its criteria. Genetic Algorithms will quite often find ways to \"cheat\" the system, and unless a deterrent in the fitness is found, the cheaters will out do the rest of the population.

The third warning is that your sandbox needs to be quite tight. It is highly improbable, but possible, that a simulation will find a way outside of the sandbox and interfere with the parent box. It is even possible (but astronomically improbable) that a new computer virus could be generated accidentally this way. Although unlikely, likelihoods is what these simulations, like natural selection in the real world, are all about.

!What next
I intend to improve my simulation, make it more browser compatible, remove some of the now useless buttons, and either lift the 100 individual limit, or place constraints on the input boxes. 

I will also do a walk through the code, and how to develop your own simulation. This was done in javascript, but any recent language will be able to handle a similar simulation.

I am placing the whole lot under the GPL3. You can download the source code [http://orionrobots.co.uk/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=32|here].

It is unable to overcome any real obstacles. Yet despite all of this, it does represent a potential for real walking machines. 

I have not explored the implications of this and I am not that interested in real war machines, but I do know that it will face many challenges before it could ever be used in such an application.

!Google Power
Google have announced that they will be investigating renewable power and try to find a source that would be as cheap as (if not cheaper than) coal. This is a fantastic idea to have a company as determined and innovative as Google put time and financial resources into this, and even if it takes a while, the advances that come from the programme will be very beneficial.

As well as their own research, they will be making grants to other companies investigating renewable energy. The focus at the moment appears to be solar energy, but there is no reason why wind, geothermal and other renewable sources would not be considered.

The project is currently under the name of Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal. Google are as far as I know the first company with such a public image to make such an investment, and as such gain a great deal of respect from me.

One clever fellow at hackaday has worked out how to turn one of these powerful capacitors into a rechargeable nine volt battery - perfect for use in robotics.

[http://hackaday.com/entry/1234000383070996/|SuperCap 9v Battery - Hackaday]

The best thing about the hack - It actually fits into a 9v battery slot - now that\'s very cool. Clearly, as the design gets absorbed into the community and refined, we may actually see some slipstreamed development in this area.

Why would you want to do this? Well the cap can hold its charge for a very long time, and with a built in switching regulator it will give better performance than many other batteries. It can also be recharged in a very short time. This cap is a seriously good performer. 

It carries few of the warnings I normally give on using rechargeable batteries with motorised devices, and because you are able to substitute the switching regulator for others.

You can then think of doing weight savings - shaving down to a smaller cap for a lightweight short run robot, or a heavier version for a larger bot. This hack has great potential.

Please ensure you understand ((robot building safety)) and the full instructions before attempting this.

This part gets interesting with a robot arm.

!Disassembling the Tribot
The first task is to disassemble the Tribot - which takes a bit longer than the studded models, and takes a fair bit more dexterity. 

Axles and pins can start to be annoying when pulling many out of a beam, and I have heard tips about using marigolds or a little strip of rubber to grip them and save your fingers. 

For the axles, the Flexible Axle part discussed on my blog [http://orionrobots.co.uk/blogs/1/132|Saturday 11th Jan] can be used - note they are all currently used in the ball holder. You should also use the push through technique with another axle. I am not sure about marigolds - they will limit my movement, and may make it difficult - but there\'s time to give them a go.

I start by removing the NXT itself, and the cables. I got stuck in, and as it turned out, the only real tool I needed was an Axle to push out pins and axles - this took me only a few minutes. 
!Building the ~np~RoboArm~/np~ T-56
{DIV(float=>right)}{img src=http://orionrobots.co.uk/show_image.php?id=447}{DIV}
Now this is where the build starts to get really interesting, and my use of studless techniques will begin to be tested. 

I got stuck into the arm. This took a little longer, and initially, it is not much like an arm. But it has enough to rotate into position and touch things, along with two hand cranks on the sides to manually override it. The arm itself cannot be positioned without the cranks because it uses a worm gear based drive. This also means that it is pretty slow, even on full power. However, it is also steady.

!Programming it

I tried the simple initial program. I had to reduce the given values a little, as my bot tended to push down hard enough on the touch to either bowl the ball off or lift the arms base. A reduction to 9 rotations on the initial downward position did the trick.

!Building the hand
{DIV(float=>left)}{img src=http://orionrobots.co.uk/show_image.php?id=448}{DIV}Well the arm is not much fun without a hand. A hand will be useful to pick up a ball and move it. Jumping ahead - I suspected that to be the challenge.

It was an interesting build - the use of the knob wheel again. I really have not used these all that much at all. On the second set of claws, I actually put the ball pin in before the knob wheels - as it looked like it would be a better plan. 

Also, if it looks like this part of the arm is not quite coming together, have a bit of faith and carry on -it does work. Wire routing is much easier here than for the buggy, but for the stuff going under the ((NXT)) I had to remove the clips on one side, to lift it up a little to get the RJ plug through.
!Programming the hand

This was a more interesting program - the switch block (or If block - as it is only really if/else and not multi-case) was introduced. 

Again, after trying it out in a vanilla version, I had to tweak values when testing to make sure it did not overshoot. It may have been more clever to use a wait until touched for the downward movement, but since ((OR)) blocks have not been introduced, it could have got messy when it couldn\'t go any further.

Even with much tweaking, it either grabs the pedestal with the ball. knocks the pedestal over before getting the ball, or knocks it over when it gets the ball. It also tends to knock over the other pedestal when dropping the ball. But at least it did pick the ball up and move it. I managed to reorganise the program so the arm lifted a little after machine the grab, and then moved, thus not knocking the pedestals over when it did so.

!Fitting the light sensor 
This will be used for sensing colour. It is a small build, but manoeuvring in the sensor assembly is a little tricky.
I also reduced the pedestal height from a 12 axle to a 10, which helps to get the arm over the pedestal without knocking it over.

In programming it, I again started with all the recommended values, but had to tweak the light sensor to the right threshold to stop them all coming out as \"blue\". The sound (speech) was pretty meek, so I upped it to 100%. And even with the reduction in height of the pedestal, the grab still seems to knock the pedestal over most times. Oh well. 

The map tab (for the extents of the NXT G-Code) is beginning to show its limits, and some normal scroll bars would be welcome here. My laptops touchpad can be configured to scroll horizontally with such bars.

After all the tweaking, the identification works, and it will move the red ball to another location as expected, if still occasionally knocking over the pedestals.

!What is next

Well - in the NXT guide, we have animals next - the scorpion - Spike.. Cool..

Until NXT time then!

These form the inspiration for our building, and sometimes certain recent science reveals surprising things that may help in building robots with such behaviours. As such, I am always interested in these behaviours, as well as animals with extra-ordinary senses or limbs. One of the great things about robotics is that you get to be multi-disciplinary like that.

Had ((Leonardo Da Vinci|Da Vinci)) not thought about animal anatomy and behaviour, perhaps he would not have designed his flying machines, tanks and robot (seriously - this is not a joke, read ((Leonardo Da Vincis Robot)) ). 

More recent uses must be the ((BEAM robots|BEAM)) technology used by ((Mark Tilden)) creator of the Wow-wee ((Robosapien)).

Anyway, I recently spotted a couple of recent studies on animal behaviour which were most definitely interesting, and may also push their estimated IQ\'s up a notch or two. I will probably post other articles on them later.

!Rats Cognitive ability better than once thought
Rats showed a few interesting abilities in a recent study at The University of Georgia, published in the Current Biology journal earlier this year.

The study, written up as a paper by Jonathon Crystal and Allison Foote, involved sound tones, with a fuzzy definition of \"short\" or \"long\", and a method of recording a decision. The rats who chose the correct duration were given a food reward, those who chose the wrong answer got no reward. A third alternative (not always available)- of backing out of the test altogether gave a much smaller food reward. This is known as a \"duration-discrimination\" test.

So the rats could gamble this smaller food reward for a potentially larger one. This shows reflection and retention of knowledge. Rats seemed to remember how this worked after a few tests, and where allowed, leave the harder ones for the smaller food rewards, taking the easy ones with extreme values of long and short. Also, over the whole test set the rats seemed to do worse on the tests without the alternative third option. 

The results showed an overall correlation that rats may have actually understood when to back out and when to gamble. It shows an ability to think about thinking, to understand the \"I just don\'t know\" state. This kind of ability could be referred to as metacognition.

One big question is if this is concious behaviour. It is certainly learning and use of acquired knowledge.

In fact, I like generally tinkering with all sorts of machines. My main desktop was once specified and built as a hard core gaming rig. It was a little past that now. But it had a bit of a wopping specification, with all the noise and power usage problems that come with it.

!My Specs
* Case: Cooler Master Centurion, Aluminium Case with blue power and HDD LED\'s. Slick, and cool.
* Geforce 6600 AGP Graphics Card - With extra power connection and large fan/heatsink rig.
* AMD Sempron 2800+ without ~np~CnQ~/np~ - this had a fairly loud fan, and ran between 45C and 60C. It got hot enough that I sometimes worried. It has a TDP of 62W according to Wikipedia (April 2007).
* 1Gb Kingston DDR Ram.
* 1x80Gb (Windows XP) + 1x160Gb (Ubuntu Feisty) IDE Hard Disk Drives - Noisy, power hungry and hot.
* Gigabyte Triton K8NS (Not the Pro) motherboard, with NForce Chipset - including on board AC-97 sound, Ethernet etc.
* Belkin Wireless-N 802.11(a/b/g/n) card.
* Internal DVD+/-RW Drive.
* 3 Additional Case fans to keep this cool.
* 600W Gold Plated Triple Fan Power Supply.

I suspect you begin to imagine what kind of monster this was. It ran hot, it hogged power, and it sounded like an jet taking off when started up. 

It was time for an upgrade. Now most applications I run, run smoothly enough on this rig, for me not to be too worried yet about going Duo Core or some other next generation architecture (at least for now), but I had a goal to reduce power usage, noise and heat generated by this machine. To turn it from a hard core rig, to a super silent (or as close as can) kind of machine. Considering how different these use cases are, this could be quite interesting.

!First Steps
Some simple things got the first few parts out of the way. I replaced the Internal DVD+/-RW with an External USB-2 one, which I can turn off when it is not needed. 

The 80Gb hard disk was also moved to an external caddy, it is the Windows drive, which I generally only use for gaming. Again, this is USB-2, and I am a little worried about game load time.

Until I make some other savings, I cannot yet replace the power supply. I still have three case fans, the Sempron, its fan and the 6600.

!The CPU
The CPU is the most interesting part of this upgrade. I read an article on about putting an AMD Turion 64 Laptop processor on a desktop motherboard. The interesting thing is that the Turion 64 uses the same socket 754 technology as the Sempron, and I might be able to fit it.

This would bring some great advantages. Not only was it a faster rated processor in terms of performance (same clock speed), but it was 64 bit. More importantly, it had a TDP (Thermal Output- Typical Dissipated Power) of around 31W - half that of the Sempron. This meant it used less power from the PSU and needed less cooling (lower fan speed or simply a smaller fan). It was obvious this was a good route to my goals.

I started doing the research - would my motherboard support it? I did not find much information specifically regarding my board, only one article on using the Turion with the K8NS-Pro motherboard - one that had a number of differences from the non pro model. The research suggested I might need a different BIOS image depending on the age of it and what kind of stepping it supported. With a Sempron that did not support Cool and Quiet voltage stepping, I had no way of knowing. Gigabyte suggested it might not.

I decided to take the risk, and buy one of these. I had to hunt around and shop around, and eventually found one on eBay for Â£65. This was the AMD Turion 64 with a Lancaster Core- the ML-30. I was actually able to collect it locally, so I was able to get underway within a day of starting. The CPU was still in a sealed static proof bag, so it was in new condition.

My next step was to remove the old CPU and fit the new one. This threw up a few issues, so I will cover this next time...

{TAGS()}PC Upgrade Silent AMD CPU Turion Sempron Gigabyte motherboard{TAGS}","title": "Silent Computer Upgrade","postId": 147}, {"FROM_UNIXTIME(created)": "2007-06-13 11:55:30","data": "In the [http://orionrobots.co.uk/blogs/1/147|last article], I talked about some of the research I had done to prepare for this. Some real thought had gone into it before I even started buying the CPU and considering the other tools and parts needed. Any project like this should have a little research done, although as this project demonstrates, you will also sometimes have think up quite a bit on the fly.

I first wanted to change the CPU, as I can change the power supply once everything else works. Unfortunately, I do not have any real means of measuring the wattage used by the setup, so I just estimated it. I am sure I could sit down and calculate it, but I had a 350 Watt supply at hand, and didn\'t want to buy another.

!Tools
I now had the CPU and needed to make sure I had the other parts present. I had a basic computer toolkit, but most importantly needed these items:
* Screwdrivers - at least 1 posi, and also one with a socket fitting for stiff screws
* Anti Static Band - This should be clipped to an earthed item, even the computers case may be used as long as it is plugged in, but switched off. This is so you do not fry the computers parts with the natural static field surrounding your body. You may also get away with not using the band, and regularly grounding yourself by touching an earthed metal area.
* A good, well lit area to work - don\'t I always recommend this? It really is important, for safety, for being able to work without being obstructed, to work with enough elbow room, and with good lighting so you can really see what you are doing. I really cannot stress enough that this is worth having for any tinkering with robots, lego or computers.
* Tissues - there will be some heat transfer compound to wipe away, and I did a bit messy with it.
* Mini Vacuum cleaner + cotton wool buds - The inside of a computer, especially around the CPU fan and heatsink will get very dusty very quickly. Make sure you have something to clean it a bit with.
* Face Mask - if you are sensitive to dust, I would have one of these and wear it.

Safety Goggles are generally not necessary for simple computer modifications/changes, at least not unless the soldering iron comes out or you go beyond the basics. However, if you are working with heat transfer compound, do not rub your eyes, and make sure you wash your hands well before consuming any food. 

Generally remember not to consume food or drink around a computer being worked on - coffee spilt on the motherboard would be a pretty nasty mess.

These are the tools I started with, but I soon found the need for others. More on that when I get there.
  
!Parts
Some basic parts I prepared for this, although this is not exhaustive, as with the tools, more things became required as I progressed.

* AMD Turion 64 ML-30 I bought last time
* Heat Transfer Compound
* Single fan quiet 350W Power Supply
* Anti-Static container to store removed Sempron CPU in.
  
!Opening up the computer
This is actually very simple, and with my case - a Cooler Master Centurion, it was a matter of undoing one thumbscrew on the top, sliding the top panel off, and then lifting off the side panel. This case is a real joy to work with - it also has turned edges to save cuts and scrapes from sharp corners.

Just make sure you put whatever screws in a safe spot where you can find them later.

!Removing the old CPU
The Sempron CPU already in the machine was, as mentioned earlier, getting pretty hot. I was using it with a genuine AMD Cooler and the heat transfer pad already present on it. 

I unclipped the cooler, and normally a gentle tug should free them of the CPU/Bracket. However, it was stuck fast. The heat transfer compound was very thin, and had also hardened somewhat. The problem with Socket 754 and later CPU\'s is that the plastic bracket the cooler clips in does not allow access to the CPU free lever. 

I had a choice of trying to run some software to really abuse the CPU and heat it up (like Prime 95, a suggestion on some websites), or to tug harder. I decided to gently tug harder. It is important here to make sure you are tugging completely vertically - any skew here will mess up the pins on the CPU, which is very bad news if you want to use it again. Luckily it came away safely (which considering I needed it again later was very important).

However, the CPU was now securely fastened to that cooler, and currently my plan was to use this cooler again. How could I get the CPU off the cooler? Well the HTC would clearly soften if there was a little heat present. I did not want too intense or focussed heat like a soldering iron. So I needed something more gentle with a large surface area. My choice was a travel iron on a low setting.

Since I am now applying heat, before I continued, I now made sure I had my goggles present.

* Travel Iron - these are much smaller than normal irons, and have a few heat settings. Put it on a lower one - try to stay between 40 and 60 degrees. DO NOT put water in the steam making area. Steam and CPU\'s do not get along well together.
* Safety Goggles - When heating (along with other things), there is a hazard of things spattering, and although HTC is not likely to, hot or cold, you really do not want that anywhere near your eyes.
* Clamp - A gentle clamp, which I padded with some foam normally used to pack motherboards, to hold the cooler in place.

I put on the goggles, and clamped the cooler to the desk, then on a side of the cooler, I gently heated it up with the iron in one hand, and slowly slid off the Sempron with the other. I then cleaned the HTC from the heat spreader on the CPU, and put it into an anti-static bag.

Since I was going to use the heatsink and fan, I then cleaned it up. I used tissue to wipe away the HTC while it was still soft, and then a mini vacuum with cotton wool buds to wipe away the dust bunnies.

!Fitting the Turion and heatsink
Now here was an issue that the Silent PC Review article had mentioned. The Turion has not got a heat spreader like the Sempron, and unlike the older open core AMD processors it did not have foam separators. I wanted to be sure that the CPU die would not be damaged by the cooler.

I initially though of pilfering the foam pads from a dormant Duron D600 I had, and use those as spacers. However, since that CPU was still last seen working, I preferred not to butcher it quite yet.

I then eyed up the cooler that accompanied this Duron, but could not find a good way to mechanically attach it to the motherboard, which is a shame because it was a smaller fan. I also considered using a fan/heatsink combo from a graphics card. These were put aside for what seemed a much simpler option...

My plan was to construct a paper gasket. This meant getting a pair of scissors, and some recycled paper - I often keep draft prints and similar paper so i can print on the back of it.
* Scissors - any decent scissors will do.
* Paper - Since you wont see it, it really does not matter what is printed on it. Perhaps one of those brochures that come through the door will do.

I measured the CPU package size first, and then measured the inner rectangle needed to clear the die and the small surface mount components around it. I cut about 10 copies of the larger rectangle, and then cut the smaller rectangle from them by folding groups of them in half and cutting into them.

I am not sure how many it took, but I put enough to clear the top of the core by a few millimetres, bearing mind that the paper will compress slightly as the pressure from the heatsink clamp comes into play.

I then placed the CPU into the socket, put the gasket around the die, and placed the heatsink onto it. It was quite clear that the heatsink was riding too high on the plastic bracket, and so I would need more paper to meet it. This also made me realise I would need a lot of HTC. This is not good.

!!About Heat Transfer Compound
HTC, also known as Thermal Grease is used to allow heat conductivity between metal surfaces, often used between a heatsink and a component needing the sink. It is not as good a conductor as the metal, and is generally used to ensure good thermal contact between two surfaces with no air bubbles or contamination. 

It is often shipped with heatsinks, with many now opting for a pad directly on the base of the heatsink so only a protective sleeve needs to be removed instead of a tube.

HTC is not designed to bridge larger gaps, but more for surfaces which would be flush to each other but for the compound, possibly with some mechanical pressure.

In this instance, the gap was too much, and although I opted for the HTC - this is not a good solution. I only used it like that for about 3 days.

My advice to anyone else trying this is to purchase the ThermalTake heatsink designed for use with a Turion processor like I later did, or to find an aluminium or copper plate of the right thickness and dimensions to fit in the inner rectangle of the gaskets, using a little thermal grease as designed above and below the plate.

!!Back to fitting the heatsink
I literally smothered the die in HTC, and used a scrap of card to spread it into the gasket like butter. I regretted that when I needed to clean it away later.

I then put the heatsink in, and felt the HTC being displaced as I wanted, then clipped the heatsink into place.  

!Powering Up
I powered up the board, and the motherboard recognised it straight away. However, going to the motherboard health settings, I noted that the CPU temperature was climbing to 40 + C pretty quickly. 

I new that the thermal connection in the set up was not great, but I had another suspect - the Silent PC review mentioned that these processors were often overvolted by the motherboards, and sure enough it was. I changed the auto setting to the recommended 1.35v. The temperature began to drop nicely again.

I then booted the OS. The first thing I noticed was that the speed is reported at 800Mhz which is half of the CPU\'s actual potential, and that no stepping seems permitted. Unfortunately the board does not properly support PowerNow on the Turion, so I shut down the OS and used the BIOS to change the multiplier. X8 was not good, although a CPU with an FSB of 200Mhz multiplied by 8 should be 1.6Ghz, the machine would power down after a minute. I then tried a few settings, and x7 with a somewhat increased FSB seemed to give me the correct 1.6Ghz.

The problem with the Turion processors, is instead of the Desktop CPU\'s which use software drivers to clock down when there is little demand from a default state of full speed, the Turions will clock up when power is needed from a default state of a much lower speed.

The BIOS did not show any setting to enable Cool N\' Quiet or PowerNow technology that can be used to control an AMD CPU\'s speed with software. I booted Ubuntu, and tried to load the powernow-k8 module but received the message \"Device not found\". Checking the DMESG log there were a number of messages to the effect of this feature not being supported by my BIOS. Net result - no software controlled CPU stepping.

However, the OS was now running fine, and stable. I did feel I was not getting the full potential to save power, but the temperature was very good, at between 32 and 35 degrees C.

In an attempt to get BIOS support for this, I went to the Gigabyte (motherboard manufacturer) support site and downloaded the latest flash code. Now - I do not have any floppy drives, so I needed to make a bootable CD.

!Making the bootable flash CD
I used Ubuntu Linux for this. I unpacked the file downloaded from Gigabyte, and also downloaded a Freedos boot disk image to tailor to my needs. I used a boot disk known as \"Ripcord\". 

With this boot disk, I was able to mount it as a loopback vfat device, and copy the files from the gigabyte archive into it. 

{CODE()}
mkdir /mnt/bootdisk
mount /home/danny/freedos.img /mnt/bootdisk -t msdos -o loop
{CODE}

You will need to run those commands as root, or by prefixing them with sudo as is the convention in Ubuntu.

The files to copy from the gigabyte archive consisted of an autoexec.bat, a flash utility and the image itself. I then built a bootable CD using the disk image.

I booted off the CD, flashed the BIOS and rebooted....

!Disaster
The motherboard would no longer boot. It would go through the graphics cards own boot screen, then immediately power down. No beep codes or error messages, just power down.

I had a sneaking suspicion that the new update (F19 - with a change log message of \"CPU Codes\") might no longer support the Turion. It is a good job I kept the Sempron around, as I planned to try booting with that and reverting to an earlier F18 BIOS image the next day. I will tell you about that in the next part...

{TAGS()}PC Upgrade Silent AMD CPU Turion Sempron Ubuntu Linux Bootdisk Gigabyte Motherboard FREEDOS{TAGS}","title": "Silent Computer Upgrade - Part II","postId": 148}, {"FROM_UNIXTIME(created)": "2007-06-29 14:51:05","data": "Robert Bigelow, a billionaire has launched a prototype space hotel, named Genesis II, into orbit via a Russian craft. It is basically a large inflatable unit, with communications and sensor clusters. Following successful positioning, the hotel is now communicating, sending back images.  

The predecessor, Genesis I was launched in July of 2006, and was also a success. As far as I know, it is still in orbit.

The experimental hotel is paving the way for its successor, already named the Nautilus according to engadget, or possibly the Galaxy followed by the SunDancer. Bigelow Aerospace has even opened up the floor for innovators to get in on making this viable with \"America\'s Space Prize\" where $50,000,000 is offered for building a craft capable of carrying a crew of five to 250km and docking with a Bigelow Aerospace module. Unfortunately - this is available only to Americans.

!What does the space hotel mean?
This is a pretty interesting development. A space hotel may have implications for the future. 

Hopefully this area may allow development of cheaper travelling methods, and push forward the space elevator project, as well as biodome systems. Including botanic gardens on such hotels, as well as considering power generation, food growing, oxygen recycling and so on would be a huge boost to the space program, and even contribute to the viability/survivability of humankind as a whole. 

Systems that can effectively process waste (and not merely launch it away) may need to be developed, pushing money into closing loops of consumption, which would help recycling efforts back here on earth.

!What Next?
I am interested in when we will see off-planet manufacturing/fabrication plants.

The advantages of an off planet fab plant are many. Contamination Free Zones would be very easy. The scale of the thing would be limited to shipping things up there, but space tourism will make this cheaper.

Since real estate is pretty cheap out there, expansion gives few costs in those terms.

With limited gravity, very large structures or machines could be constructed, as well as fabrication systems that take advantage of weightlessness by projecting things at slower speeds.

Solar power, as well as atomic power systems can be used in ways that are either not so efficient or safe on earth. 

Hopefully such systems will not need to be manned, as a downside would be very cheap labourers sent off-world to such labs.
!Cost
However, all of this comes at a cost. Rockets burn a huge amount of fuel, and this all ends up adding to the carbon footprints. Systems must be engineered to maintain stable orbits or occupy midpoints with few gravitational influences.

Just found a rather cool machine (created by user StolenSpam) that uses two motors to choose between operating 12 (which could be more or fewer). Only one output motor can run at one time.

It does (as the comments note) have an issue that the gears not being targeted are moved as the arm moves past, cause some kind of crosstalk between them.

I think a possible solution is to use clutch gears with a spring, so when the change arm is at rest the gear is connected, and before the change arm starts to move, the gear is pulled away. Pulling away in this configuration could simply mean pushing that drive gear upwards. As the assembly is moved upwards, the clutch is engaged, and the transmission arm can then move.

I suspect the helical (worm gear) could be used to convert that rotation to an upward motion, and simple gravity can be used instead of the spring in an initial spin. Yet another thing for me to try building at some point in time.

!Sad news about the Scaled Composites Guys
Scaled Composites LLC is the company headed up by Burt Rutan which one the Ansari ~np~X-prize~/np~ with their craft ~np~SpaceShip~/np~ One. They were subsequently associated with the Virgin Galactic venture who are considering the concept of offering space tours in the not-too-distant future.

~np~SpaceShip~/np~ One was a manned spacecraft which was designed by non governmental agencies, and was suborbital, and reusable.

However, this week Scaled Composites had a disaster while trialling a larger, more advanced ship, rather unimaginatively named ~np~SpaceShip~/np~ Two. This is designed to carry passengers.

A fatal explosion at the Mojave Air And Space Port, which killed three and injured badly another three, occurred at around 2:30pm on Thursday the 26th  (July, 2007). It is thought to be a tank of nitrous oxide that went up. Nitrous Oxide is used as an oxidiser to another combustible fuel. It was testing of the oxidiser flow through a component (which can lead to quite vigorous and even violent chemical reactions) that resulted in this.

The explosion was violent enough to have been heard and flung debris as far as two miles away. Some debris was considered toxic, and firefighters were dispatched to the site of the blast.

Virgin and Burt Rutan are obviously very disappointed, although they are not going to give up on their efforts. This is rocket science, and not without its risks. I really hope they continue too, and that they can learn from the incident in some way to prevent it occurring again.

The spaceport authority have stated that they consider it a tragedy, but not a setback. They are obviously very sympathetic to the victims and victims families. 

!Comment on my article regarding the space hotel
One reader (thanks Will!) mentioned to me a few facts regarding my blog post previously on this, correcting some of my notes, and also pointing out a few other notes. 

He pointed out that when space rocket launches are done correctly, they actually have a fairly low environmental impact, even in comparison with helicopters and cars. This is down to not using the same kinds of hydrocarbon fuel that conventional vehicles use. That is not to say they do not use a large amount of energy, but that it is very clean burn energy, such as liquid hydrogen and then a liquid oxidiser.

Here is hoping that efficient space craft and space hotels really do begin to become a viable commercial reality in the next decade or so.

This kind of mission is possibly one of the best uses of robotic technology, and in emergencies, I expect search and rescue robots to play an increasingly important part. In this case, since it has been three weeks since the men were trapped, it is sadly not very hopeful that survivors will be found.

The rover in question was developed in a very short timescale, with engineers working round the clock. What they have developed is, according to Nanaimo News Bulletin, \"strong enough to pull a pick up truck and tough enough to withstand a direct blast from a land mine\". It carries a 360 degree camera system, and will fit into a 22.5 cm (8 7/8-inch) drilled shaft. The robot is not independent and will descend with a long umbilical for control, and link with a large fibre optic cable for the video. It weighs in at 30 kilograms, and uses caterpillar tracks for traction.

While this has come a little late for the actual rescue needed, the companies expect to learn from this and be able to help out more with similar situations in the future.

The company building the robot, Inuktun are based in Nanaimo. The company specialise in remote control robots used for tunnel and pipe inspection. They were also involved in robots used for search and rescue operations in the aftermath of September the 11th 2001.

This ROV kit is fairly simple, in that it contains the frame tubing, propellers, a tethered controller, outboard power source, camera and light. It requires only tools and glue to construct. At $250 (about Â£130 at todays rates) it is a little expensive compared with a total DIY system, but it is definitely a good starting point for those who do not have the time or wherewithal to construct the ROV from scratch.

The frame design is used to avoid much concern about aerodynamics - water can simply flow right through the open frame. This is an inexpensive way of creating any unmanned craft - with only individual modules being waterproofed.

On the Engadget site there is a video of the device in action, be warned, it comes with very cheesy electronic music.

It would be interesting to consider how this could be untethered - I will admit I know little of underwater limitations on RF transceivers. The other really important limitation would be the battery, although recent announcements on flexible paper like batteries may allow much better distribution of batteries giving the low density needed to keep the craft relatively buoyant.

The Amazon mechanical turk is a system where small jobs that are easy for humans to do, and easy for computers to divide up, collate and organise are distributed among said humans by said computers. For some, the human is paid for their effort, and others are free. Each small job, which may take mere minutes of your time or less, is called a HIT.
This set is a fairly worthy cause, and therefore no payment is offered. These are quite fun, and feel rewarding. I am personally trying to hit the 1000 HITs submitted mark.

I have been reading recently about SELENE - ~np~SELenological and ENgineering Explorer~/np~ - a Japanese probe that was sent to the moon on the 14th September. SELENE and its payload of around 13 scientific instruments successfully reached Lunar orbit on the 3rd of October. It was launched from the the remote island Tanegashima Space Center. 

Its mission is a year long project to map and study the lunar surface. It is in orbit at around 100km from the moon, and will begin its mapping studies towards the latter half of December. The mission has been a long time in the making, with the original launch intended for 2003.

For those who are wandering, selenological means lunar astronomy. The alternative name, \"Kaguya\" was named after a mythical princess of the moon, while \"Selene\" is a Greek Godess of the moon

It is pleasing that the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency - JAXA have been met with success on a lunar exploration, and will hopefully have similar stories with other space related research including manned missions, probes to Mars and other planets in the solar system. Since China and India are also planning probes and manned missions of their own, the heat is on for a new space race. China has already stated in intends to launch a lunar probe before the end of the year, and India have plans for a launch of its Chandrayaan-1 in April.

It is so very apt that all of this has come around at the 50th anniversary of the Sputnik satellite, which kicked off the original space race between soviet Russia and the US. I cannot help feeling disappointed that politicians have dragged their heels so long that we are still only taking such light and costly baby steps 50 years later. Hopefully a new race will herald falling costs and lower the barrier to enter space exploration, space commercialisation, space tourism and even space colonisation.

This will hopefully be enough of a challenge to get the American and European space agencies moving - as they seem to have stagnated a little. If the recent announcements by American opposition politicians are anything to go by, then the US will enter a new phase of scientific and technological advancement too. Now all that is left is for Europe to get moving too.

However, while I don\'t mind hosting landing pages for the basics or information and tracking here, I need somewhere to host them under subversion control (as they already are locally).

According to [http://www.darcynorman.net/2005/04/01/subversion-hosting-on-sourceforge|D\'Arcy Normans blog] and [http://www.bieberlabs.com/wordpress/archives/2005/03/18/sourceforge-to-offer-subversion-service|Bieber Labs] Sourceforge are seriously considering this, but have not yet taken the plunge. The concern is, both of those articles are fairly early in the year, and sourceforge have removed all references to it - have they given it up? The frustration at lack of subversion support on sourceforge has been vented at numerous places, for example in this older article [http://weblogs.java.net/blog/eitan/archive/2004/12/i_want_my_subve.html|Eitan Suez: I want my Subversion].

Have any readers got any ideas? The few tikiwiki extensions I have created, as well a couple of generic python projects, and a forthcoming design system need to go here, so your answers will benefit the tikiwiki community as well as me. I am certain the hosts I pay for the site could not support the combination of svn + trac I would like, and as these projects are to be released free to the community, I would hope that there is some place to host such projects freely.

This actually led me to looking up data on the condition ((Prosopagnosia)) and writing a page on it. It has interesting implications in AI, and leads me to believe that by focussing on the different aspects of facial processing in different functions/processors we may achieve better facial recognition, and facial reading (that is gaining information from someone\'s face). It most clearly shows that facial recognition is a separate function from other aspects of this.  

Use of facial recognition, when harnessed with iris scanning could be a very powerful method of biometric recognition - which has vast implications in crime prevention. It is my understanding that security forces are already investigating the technique, with the best use of it being on airport cameras and CCTV in high risk areas. However, like all biometrics, it would require having data in the first place on who to recognise, and also could be abused to. Anyone who has seen \'\'Minority Report\'\' could imagine targeted advertising based upon facial recognition.

I also have found out that scientists now consider the feeling of trust to be hormonally based, and that they have isolated the substance that does this in studies. This has deep implications. The first being that this has a terrible power for misuse, especially when coupled with pheromones. But it also implies how yet another human emotion is based upon this chemical saturation of the brain, and how it is actually implemented through suppression of receptors to fear and mistrust. It shows that the natural state of the brain in these conditions is actually mistrust, which is why trust generally has to be earned/achieved. Naturally - this means an imbalance of this hormone can lead to paranoid delusional behaviour, or equally very gullible and naive behaviour.

!History
I will start with a little history - OrionRobots has been through a few CMS (Content Management System) tools in the last 4 years. It started life as a basic AMP (Apache MySQL PHP) database of articles of my own, and was turned into a site based on Slashcode (which I found a little too heavy), then PHPSlash which I eventually realised was not quite the required format. I then found Zope, which ran using Python- very expandable, but extremely heavyweight, and at that time, its wiki component was very unreliable and not being maintained very much. I finally settled, and have stayed for around 2 years now on Tikiwiki. 

!Tikiwiki
Tikiwiki is very lightweight, yet fully featured. It is stable, well developed and easily styled. Although it is rough around the edges, I do have my migration script I created then for getting my zope content into tiki.

It has a few problems, it is not the fastest tool, though notably faster than Zope. It still has issues with modularity, and expansion - though the very active community (of which I am part and am working on a few mods of my own) are working to improve it a great deal. I find the galleries and file galleries useful, and the addition of subgalleries was great, but a more directory like structure (which Zope did have) might be useful. Tiki is undergoing quite rapid development and feels very right for what I do.

!Bitweaver
But this week, I came across something new, and decided to evaluate it for testing - Bitweaver. Bitweaver actually started life as \"TikiPro\", a fork of Tikiwiki. It is far more modular, and fell out with the tiki maintainer over the use of PhpBB. In my evaluation - I notice it is much faster than tiki because of fewer database hits and optimized code. It only loads or installs the required modules. 

So I made sure my test server was up to spec, met all the requirements (since I run a couple of tiki test sites, it was pretty much there already), downloaded Bitweaver1.1, and installed it. I will freely admit, since it is closely related to tikiwiki, and since I am very comfortable with tikiwiki - I compared it most closely with tiki.

Bitweavers installation was very shiny and easy, although, since installation is a rare operation, and I am very comfortable installing tikiwiki, I don\'t consider it that important. Once installed, and clicking around the sample data from the installation - the speed difference between this and tiki running on the same box was quite notable. It is definitely nippier. The only thing that has not undergone a speedup is the search system, which is quite slow, clunky and a little unreliable - a problem shared by the tiki search - and the reason I pair up with a google sitesearch bar.

What really strikes me is most definitely the \"packages\". Packages give a nice way to integrate new behaviour into a site, including taking pristine code from other AMP applications and making minimal changes to integrate them. You could (for example) probably take Squirrelmail, and integrate it the site - wrapping the user logins and making a few style changes, while keeping most of the core functionality close enough that merging new versions of squirrelmail wouldn\'t be too onerous.

Some of the existing packages are very nice as well. The \"liberty\" package - a component in the default distribution, integrates and standardises some content much closer than tikiwiki does. The \"nexus\" menu system seems interesting too.

The wikibooks (which directly rival tiki structures) allow multiple content types. It still suffers from tiki\'s problems creating PDF\'s which tend not to keep wiki formatting, but show the markup behind it. As well as greater content flexibility (drawing on \"liberty\" probably) it is also a little nicer in terms of usability here.

However, It has fallen behind in many respects - it does not offer the internationalised wiki pages that tiki has. It lacks spellchecking - a small feature that is actually quite important when trying to present good and accurate content.

Its developer documentation, and general documentation tends to be a lot more complete than tikiwiki\'s. Though I still couldn\'t always find what I was looking for.

Unfortunately - their use to integrate phpBB at the expense of tikiforums strikes me as a bad choice. Tikiwiki forums integrate well with the rest of a tiki site, as do much of the tikiwiki components. So maybe - someone will come out with a package that integrates tikiwiki forums, or a phpBB plugin to \"tikiwikify\" it a bit more. Of course, I know there are those who will prefer phpBB - so having the choice would be fantastic. I don\'t have the time myself to integrate tikiforums back into a bitweaver package though.

Also on my test installation, some operations, including a simple search produced many warnings - which were visible on the rendered page, and I (I reported the bug) also experienced a \"white page of death\". It just seems a little less stable and together than tikiwiki. This doesn\'t quite feel \"enterprise ready\" in the same way tiki has served me. 

!Summary
In summary, Bitweaver has huge potential, but it needs a little more time - I will probably come back and take a look again in about 6 months, and see where it has gone. Some of the features seen in bitweaver may also be backported in tikiwiki. I am staying with Tikiwiki for now.

The problem (number 1343 in their regular enigma column) was thus:
Find the largest whole number, whose digits are different, and do not include 0, that is divisible by all of its individual digits.

After playing with it, and reading around a little, I came up with a small python script which could solve the problem in 10 to  15 seconds on my machine - and that is not on an unused machine.

!Some notes on my assumptions
As any even number x 5 make a 10, which would not be allowable because of the 0 rule, the number probably does not include a 5. This assumption, which reduces the possibilities vastly is used throughout the code.

The code uses a string form of the number quite extensively since the digits are so important here. The skipnumberatindex function is not as clean as I would like - but it does what it is supposed to very well. 

So - here is my code - for fun and bragging rights:

{CODE()}def hasrepeatingnumber(numstr):
        for digit in numstr:
                first = numstr.find(digit)

                return number - 1

        digit = numstr[index]

I have created another Mecha. After I finally built the CAD files for my War Of The Worlds creation, I disassembled them, and tried to start building creations from the Lego sourcebook in the titan XP set again. I got as far as building the second mecha - a short stubby thing, and was inspired to building this. You can probably see the inspiration, and the feet and forearms started life as the legs/arms for that mecha - although everything has definitely been altered, and it looks very little like the inspiration mech now. It would be unfair not to give credit where its due though.

After building more MOC\'s than original sourcebook sets immediately after opening it, I have to really credit Lego for creating one of their most inspiring sets yet. Who knows what I will think to build before I get through the whole sourcebook? There were interesting build techniques, and some pieces I didn\'t yet have in my collection in the set.

Now - to my creation.
!MAD-CM-01 - Specs
This section gives a bit of story for people who are into mecha and like that kind of thing.
{img src=show_image.php?id=329&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=329}

MADs designation is \"Medium Armoured ~np~Dexterous-Combat~/np~ Mech - Revision 01\". 
It is a very versatile mech, combining a dexterous hand with flexible fingers designed for gripping, punching or using hand-held weapons, with some reasonable artillery including a large rotary cannon and a missile pack.

For speed, and scout missions, it can be deployed without the missile pack:

{img src=show_image.php?id=328&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=328}

Being fairly sleek, it can get up into a run, and has very human movements.

{img src=show_image.php?id=343&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=343}

It can be equipped with a hand-gun which fits well into its dexterous fingers:
{img src=show_image.php?id=338&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=338}

!Build challenges
This mecha was built around the click-ball-joint parts which are generously supplied in the 4508 kit. This meant I had to think of the positioning and movements of them a fair bit to get the poseability I wanted. I will freely admit I am not 100% happy with it.

I am not sure really if I adhered to any particular style (animÃ© mech/battlemech/mechwarrior). One good thing about keeping myself limited to the Titan XP set is that there is already a nice vivid colour scheme to work with.

I had a bit of trouble with balance at first, but it can stand fairly well now, although open stances are preferred, which is fine when going for the \"dug in with heavy weapons\" look.

I had to bolster up my arm design, although the outside remained the same, I ended up disassembling each of the upper arms a few times to try and add more strength in them, as I had a few disaster moments of trying to rotate the forearm click hinges - and the whole assembly popping apart as I did so.


!Poses
A mech like this couldn\'t be done justice without a few class poses.

MAD draws back for a punch
{img src=show_image.php?id=332&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=332}

I built a sword to go with MAD using parts form the Titan set, as this was a constraint I had pretty much set myself and stuck with. Unfortunately - it looked severely blocky. So for a pose with a sword, I used a rotor blade from the recent technic prop plane model.

I celebrated in style, in Westminster, London, watching the amazing firework show put on framed by the London Eye. Well done London!

2005 has been a good year for OrionRobots, bringing the website past the 1 million mark and seeing our involvement in the open source community. It was the year that the Darpa Grand Challenge was actually won, and that the International Robotics Exhibition in Japan began to make the media sit up and pay attention. 

Of course, there were lower notes like the devastating Tsunami, the London Tube Bombings, and the hurricanes. But each of these events have presented opportunities for learning and growth. We will become better at predicting, and preparing for natural disasters, we may even learn methods of preventing some of them including controlled explosions at fault lines and better climate awareness. London has shown its solidarity, strength and dignity in the face of the bombings, and who knows what technological innovation the antiterrorism operations in the UK and indeed the world will bring. So the high note from all of these is we will learn, and become stronger and better for it. 

In 2006, we will see the subject of robotics begin to hold the media more, and with the advent of easy access to digital cameras and video recording mobile phones, internet coverage of hobbyist robots like many readers here build will grow massively. You are encouraged to use our facilities to record your robot builds, please let me know if you would like an OrionRobots based blog for yourself. We will probably see more interplanetary missions, and robots being used for more tasks in the emergency services and national security roles.

As for myself, I will be carrying on with my building, and I am looking to go on the road with my pyramid challenge. Watch this space for more information - lets just say, all robot builders can have a shot at it - but how many will make the grade! OrionRobots is looking forward to a new year, with our eyes open and the sky is the limit here.","title": "Happy New Year!","postId": 51}, {"FROM_UNIXTIME(created)": "2006-01-05 18:53:14","data": "{DIV(float=>right)}{img src=show_image.php?id=357}{DIV}In September 1998, hobbyist robot builders woke up the world over to robot building when the original ((Lego RCX)) was released. It changed everything. The plastic toy of our childhood resurfaced as a leader in technology- and created the army of ((AFOL|AFOLS)) - adult fans of ((Lego)), a completely unexpected group who were contributing, collaborating and hacking the product in ways Lego could not have dreamed of. ((Lego)) watched, saw satellite businesses spring up, and even encouraged this. New sensors, devices, programming systems and even complete ((OS|OS\'s)) resulted. The ((Lugnet|Lugnet Lego community)) and Lego hosted discussion sites- and Lego\'s best selling toy went from strength to strength.

But then the company hit trouble, they lost touch with this community, and invested heavily in License deals. It produced a raft of badly received toys, and then announced that to save costs it would rein in and focus its market again. During this time, the community rumour mill speculated, was the amazing ((Mindstorms)) to be dropped or revamped. Lego stayed silent. They released the ((Spybotics)) kits, which were interesting, but fairly limited in comparison.

During this time, the community continued to innovate, but the niggles of the ((RCX)) were becoming well known. It was too awkward to interface with, sure there were custom sensors, but it was such a task to create them. There were not enough ports, the ((IR)) often played up, the ((RCX)) Code system did not go down well. As result of these, massive innovation in the community continued, but frustration brewed, and people were looking at other systems. They starting considering using alternative ((microcontrollers)) with Lego, like the ((XRC)), or those less targeted at Lego like the ((OOPic)), but not before voicing their issues publicly.
{DIV(float=>left)}{img src=show_image.php?id=359}{DIV}
Lego it appears were listening, and in secrecy, quested after some of the top contributors to the community, brought them together and formed the MUP - the Mindstorms User Panel. This included Steve Hassenplug, a driving force behind the ((Great Ball Contraption)) efforts, from Lafayette, Indiana, along with John Barnes, David Schilling, and Ralph Hempel (who is known for his pneumatic compressor designs). Between them, and Lego\'s own SÃ¸ren Lund, they conspired to create something amazing.

On January the 4th, at the Consumer Electronics Show 2006, Lego announced the NXT - the Next step in the Mindstorms line. This amazing creation has rekindled the community interest, and further extends its open doors, by now looking to take on 100 volunteers, who will buy the set early at reduced price, and contribute to the total experience.

{BOX}{DIV}
The ((NXT)) looks like an iPod - sleek and beautiful. But don\'t let the exterior fool you, inside this baby, there is a fast and powerful 32 bit ((microcontroller)). It has 3 output ports, which support intelligent geared servo motors - these motors have positional feedback, and can be positioned in 1 degree increments. It comes with 4 input ports - with a touch sensor, light sensor - which can detect colour and intensity, a sound sensor which is capable of dealing with tone and patterns - allowing you to command your creation, and also an ultrasound sonar sensor, allowing it to \"see\" around it a little. The ((RCX)) has grown up. It has a direct ((USB|USB 2.0)) connection to a computer, alleviating all of the issues with the ((IR)) brick. But it also packs a ((Bluetooth)) communication system.

In terms of expandability, there have been those asking \"what about visual processing, cameras?\", the answer here is that the Bluetooth may well support camera phones. Also, those who complained about the complexity of interfacing sensors and actuators with it may be pleased to hear that the two wire system has now been dropped for a 6 wire system, based upon an RJ style connector - much like the telephone or Ethernet plugs you probably have in your home or workplace. This means no more  dealing with the time-shared signal/voltage line on the sensors, or problems interfacing with a ((PWM)) motor.

The kit it comes with will have 519 elements, mostly studless (\"liftarm\") based, as well as styling pieces for a more \"organic\" and less angular look - although, there are also elements for creating more square constructions, as during the design, Steve Hassenplug brought up how awkward it was to build square frames with them. There are new right angle parts, design for connecting studless beams more conveniently.
{img src=show_image.php?id=360&thumb=1 link=tiki-browse_image.php?imageId=360}
The ((RCX)) code system has also been dropped, in favour of LABview based software. ((RCX)) users familiar with Robolab will take to it easily, though ((NQC)) users may find it alien, but it is supposed to aid rapid development and combined with the building elements, give a much faster time from concept to device. The software will run on Windows, and Mac, though there is no word on Linux port. This may be only a matter of time, if ((Lego)) are as open with this as they were with the ((RCX)), before there will be many alternative software systems.
{DIV(float=>left)}{img src=show_image.php?id=356}{DIV}
Lego and the MUP team have kept all of this visionary change under wraps until the 4th - and surprised us all with this. I am still reeling, but now I know where the budget is going!

They left a couple of things out, for example an ((AC)) adaptor (which was available on the ((RCX)) 1.0), and they didn\'t take on the requests for a greater number of sensor or motor ports.

Like many enthusiasts, I personally cannot wait to get one, and I will most definitely be applying to try to be one of the 100.

[http://www.lego.com/eng/service/faqs.asp?section=ConsumerService-FAQ-Products&catid=E8D0CD47-16B8-4B2F-900C-8FC40C163598&faqid=1529#1529|Lego FAQ on Mindstorms NXT]

The device is purely a USB device, and cannot be configured as host. That is not to say that the clever community don\'t come up with some hack to get more out of its ((USB)) connector, who knows. One suggestion is a simple host board, which requests a particular file from one of its devices, and then uses that as a set of instructions to act upon. This would mean a ((microcontroller)) on the board. Beware that power requirements will be important there. There is a product named something like USB2Go which may provide this kind of capability. However - it is not clear what kind of USB devices the NXT will sport, but if its memory can be treated like a block device (that is a USB memory stick) or there is some sort of logging via USB protocol (which the ((Lego RCX|RCX)) sported so is very likely) then that could be used.

There are a number of bits and bobs of information on what kind of power supply can be used. Lego have ruled out an A/C power supply, but there are mentions of it in the education press releases, as well as a LIon rechargeable power pack. It is unlikely that the batteries could be charged via USB while it is live. It certainly could not be powered by USB as there is not enough current on a normal USB hub to power the motors.

Myself - I am keeping an eye on what the sensor and motor connectors turn out to be, as well as how much use can be got from the Bluetooth connectivity. 

The connectors appear to be RJ12, though there has been much speculation, and it may the polarising plastic tab which defines it from other non-Lego Rj style connectors, just to keep little hands from plugging phones or Ethernet cables into their NXT to see what would happen. 

Old sensors and motors from the ((Lego RCX|RCX)) are not directly compatible with the NXT, but it appears that there may be a lead from ((DACTA)) to adapt the old 2x2 brick/2 core style Lego sensors and motors to work with the NXT.

The bluetooth connectivity certainly could be used to create a piconet of NXT\'s, and there may even be some active bluetooth sensors that work with this in the pipeline. Could a camera phone handset with a bit of Java programming become a Vision Command stand in? Or a PDA with large storage, faster processor (generally ARM based as well) work with it? Imagine using GPS on a PDA with this.

Either way, it is becoming very clear that even though the ((IR)) ports, and old sensors  are going away, there are going to be some pretty excellent ways to interface with this.

First - you may have noticed things are a bit slow on OrionRobots at the moment, this is because I am preparing for a new phase - with a better looking design, new features and in preparation for some changes. We will be considering our hosting setup, for which a number of options have presented themselves, and we may even alter the underlying CMS software.

I also watched, with some fun, the Iron Mecha competition on [http://news.lugnet.com/build/mecha|Lugnet.mecha] - but with everything on, I still have not finished my entry - so I missed the actual closing date, but I may still persevere to create something in its likeness. 

I am waiting, with anticipation, who will be in the 100 lucky ((Lego)) people who will be in the extended ((Mindstorms)) Developers Panel (MDP). I do not know what my chances are, but I would certainly be honoured to be part of it. Good luck to all those who have hopefully applied for this. The NXT is most definitely a welcome addition to the wealth of robot kits and devices in the hobby. Meanwhile, there has been some investigation of the use of bluetooth with the ((ooPIC)). Maybe using an ((I2C)) based ((bluetooth)) adaptor, then the ((ooPIC)) and the NXT could be combined. There are those who are already looking to put an ((IR)) serial port to ((Bluetooth)) adaptor as well, so the NXT and the ((Lego RCX|RCX)) have a chance of working together.

Meanwhile, I have been hampered in many of my endeavours by some problems with the ISP from which I normally edit or interact with OrionRobots. They are in very bad shape, and have not delivered any service since the end of December. Unfortunately, due to the way which the BT exchanges work, I have not been able to take up another provider. Hopefully - things will return to some form of normality soon, and more regular updates to OrionRobots will occur.

The six legged robot has avoided complete computer based control in favour of \'\'Physarum Polycephalum\'\', colonies of a single celled organism, which moves away from light preferring the dark and humid places of its favourite prey, other moulds, bacteria and fungi.

To achieve this, the created a circuit board in a six-pointed star shape, and then grew the mould over it. The moulds attempts to move away from the light cause electrical changes in the circuit, which were then relayed to the legs of the robot causing it to move away from the light. The light itself was indeed relayed to the mould, by being picked up by electronic light sensors, which in turn shine lights on the points of the star. The vivid yellow mould will then attempt to move to the less bright parts of the star, representing the darker parts of the environment.

Currently the control is remote, and still involves a computer to interpret, and relay the moulds movements to the legs. However, Zauners team are working on incorporating it into one box. The hexapod would then become an extension to the mould, taking in its photophobic behaviour. 

Zauner mentions, in an article on New Scientist, that his team are looking for nanoscale applications, and are looking to biology to provide the simplicity, that others, such as ((Mark Tilden)) are using ((BEAM)) technology to achieve.

It has suddenly become very, very difficult, as my home broadband (from where most, if not all my interaction with the site is made), is now dead. As a doornail.

I made the mistake of option for e7even broadband. They performed an \"upgrade\" in the first week of January, and on January the 4th, I lost all form of connection. They became uncontactable, by phone or email and didn\'t respond for a very long time to any written communications.

Now I am having to either post from work, or via an old 56k modem which I managed to dig out. So I advise you all to seriously avoid this company, and if you are using them, to cancel, and try and reclaim your money from then with a credit card chargeback (which I couldn\'t as it had been too long from the payment date). This highly disreputable company are not even contactable by ofcom - who I have also been speaking with to try and resolve the situation.

The company owe me money until around July. They also have not removed their marker from my line, thus obstructing me from simply going with any other broadband provider. In the UK, because of the way BT operates, although it is I who pays the line rental, a misbehaving broadband company can indefinitely prevent you from getting broadband elsewhere by simply not getting around to cancelling it from the line.

Anyway - if you are affected by this - some links to vent your frustration:
*[http://www.broad-bandits.com/] - The site is not yet Firefox friendly, although that is expected to be sorted. They are gathering complaints about all broadband providers - e7 seem to have the most.
*[http://bbs.adslguide.org.uk/showthreaded.php?Cat=&Board=e7even] - The ADSLGuide is a well known source of information concerning broadband companies. This board is where other users of e7even have tried to consider ways to get some sort of service again.
*[http://www.ofcom.org.uk/complain/internet/e7even/] - E7even even have their very own page on ofcom - who have heard of them, but seem absolutely powerless to do anything.
*[http://www.otelo.org.uk] - Another service to complain to regarding ISP\'s, but also who seem powerless to actually take any action.

I am in the process of trying many different ways (multi-pronged attack if you like) to get a phone line which I can use for broadband. I also recommend that people beware of paying third parties line rental on wholesale deals from BT. If you have any kind of issue with the BT line, the middle party may actually become very unhelpful, and BT will point blank refuse to help you directly - after all, why should they - your contract is with the other third party, even though it is only BT engineers who can actually repair the line problem.

One thing I have learned from this is to take great care with services as important to me as broadband and phone. I admit until these point, I really had not considered how much I took it for granted. But I will not be buying the cheapest broadband any more. I will be looking on the forums and internet at what customers are saying about them, carefully weighing the deals, and only agreeing to paying monthly for any services.

In a recent discussion on [http://news.lugnet.com/robotics|lugnet.robotics], the original touch sensors for the RCX are revealed as not being entirely ((binary)) but actually having an ((analogue)) range of values. This in an interesting development. It may be that this is simply an accident caused by the switches manufacture, and that it should be just on or off, but Philo (Phillipe Hurbaine) has actually put together an experiment to test its sensitivity.

{img src=http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Philo/Touch/touchtest1.jpg link=http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=514060 desc=\"The touch sensor test RIG\"}
This test allowed Philo to gain fine control of the placement of the threaded axle. Note there is a manual handle, linked to one worm gear, which turns a pinion (8t gear) which is linked to a further worm gear, giving a massive gear reduction. While this may allow fine control - at this level of granularity, gear lash (the amount of \"play\" you have between the gears where the teeth do not entirely meet) can be a major problem.

{img src=http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Philo/Touch/touchtest2.jpg link=http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=514058 desc=\"A Closeup of the RIG\"}

If you look at the closeup, there is a nut (threaded bush) on the threaded axle here, and this can be adjusted to a point where it is just touching, but not yet compressing the switches actuator. 

{img src=http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/Philo/Touch/resist_vs_displ.gif link=http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=514059 desc=\"Graph of results\"}

It is a neat setup, and allowed Philo to generate a graph, showing the results of the experiment, with different switches used in the rig. It is interesting to note that the different sensors for ((cybermaster)) have very varied ranges - these are the ones which each included a resistor which gave them different values. What would equally interest me would be if the sensitivity of these would appear different on different RCX models, and also the other programmable bricks with compatible ports, and how much the port setup affects the sensitivity. Note also that two RCX switches were tested, with slight different results. This means that to use them effectively, you may have to calibrate individual switches. 

The sensitivity curve here shows clearly that the Red ((cybermaster)) switch has the best curve, and would be easiest to calibrate. There is sensitivity in all of them to detect pressure changes, although sometimes it is too minimal to be useful. You would need some clever mechanical linkages to scale movements down enough to make these into serious analog sensors, but it certainly could be done.

On this note, I may revisit my ((Lego)) scales, and see if they can be built to take advantage of this, it would be interesting to be able to create a set of sensitive digital scales with the basic ((RIS)) kit.

On a further note, Philo also has his own observations on this at [http://news.lugnet.com/robotics/rcx/?n=2191].

Bob Fay, a regular poster to [http://news.lugnet.com/robotics|lugnet.robotics] has created a short guide to opening up and cleaning the brick, with a few warnings that \"this procedure is at your own risk\".

However - if you are finding that your ((Lego RCX|RCX\'s)) buttons or ((IR)) port are not responding properly, and could be a bit grubby after a few years of (mis)use, then this would be a worthwhile project. Its probably worth setting aside a full Sunday afternoon with no distractions to do the job properly.

His guide is designed primarily for the RCX brick which came with an external power supply plug, but may also be usable to some degree with the others.

!Tools
You will require the following tools:
* Small Philips Screwdriver
* A thin flat edge (you could use your fingernail as he suggests also)
* A flat surface, i.e. a well lit work desk
* Some ~np~Q-Tips~/np~ (or cotton wool buds), and Tape Head/CD cleaner or similar alcohol based solvent.

Also it is advisable to wear Safety goggles, as the plastic may snap or the push-button springs may ping up.

This includes the starter kit, programmable ((NXT)) bricks, a full range of sensors and motors, the Software, a BlueTooth Dongle, and the rechargeable battery. It is priced fairly reasonably, and in US dollars, and it would be interesting to know if the UK prices will be conversions of these at exchange rates, or merely the same numbers with the GPB currency symbol (as Lego have done before).

I will probably be purchasing from this range as opposed to the home user version - as the rechargeable battery has clear advantages over the basic system.

Also announced is that ((FLL)) teams should not buy this set, but a special selected kit which will be available from the 8th May 2006 upon registration, and shipped in August. They have not announced the cost of this set yet.

!Mup Selected
Finally - for those holding their breath, it appears that the NXT MUP panel have now been selected, and the emails announcing those who have been chosen have all gone. I was not selected - so like many of you, I have to wait for the summer release. It appears that there were in the region of 5000+ applicants for this, so you can imagine how very difficult the process of shortlisting 100 would have been.

OrionRobots now has an exclusive on the fun at the New Jersey Storming Robots event, which took place in the Hilton in Brunswick New Jersey throughout last week and the weekend.

Eric Sophie summed up most of it with the brief words \"What a great time!\", and it was. 

{img src=show_image.php?id=375 width=400 height=300 desc=\"The Storming Robots Booth\"}

!Day 1 - March 3rd 2006
{DIV(float=>right)}{img src=show_image.php?id=374 width=400 height=300 desc=\"Rebecca Explains\"}{DIV}The interest was high , with many people, parents and teachers and children alike, curious and asking questions. Elizabeth Maybrey, Director of Storming Robots, and Rebecca, the programme manager as well as Eric Sophie were speaking to many about the benefits of using ((Lego)) ((Mindstorms)) as a learning platform.

Plenty of teachers and educators came to tell their own stories, and mentioned Lego Masters they have at schools. It may be worth point out here that Eric posts to ((lugnet)) with the moniker \"LegoMaster\". 

One proud parent pipped up \"My son is the king of Lego!\". She was then directed to take a look at Jama moving, and came to the conclusion that maybe her son had a little way to go, and that his love of ((Lego)) would probably get him there. The enthusiasm expressed was clear, and like many others, she was raising the master builders and engineers of the future. Eric pointed out with a smile that he loved Lego when he was very young too.

!!Jama 
{DIV(float=>left)}{img src=show_image.php?id=373 width=400 height=300 desc=\"Elizabeth Presents Programming\"}{DIV}As expected, the upper half of Jama (Eric\'s star robot peice) was displayed for demonstration. Elizabeth focussed on programming the bot using ((RoboLab)). Throughout the demonstrations, the group found a way to incorporate a touch sensor into Jama\'s arm, making programming easier. 

They programmed Jama\'s arm to move about, and this was a real crowd pleaser. The light sensor in Jama\'s chest was programmed to trigger behaviours in Jama\'s arm.

Unfortunately Eric did not take a camera on the first day, so no gallery pictures from it.This was excusable given that he had woken at 6am to drive to his studio, pack up Jama, and another of his creations \"Mr Krinkle\" and transport them to the event. The days events finished at 4pm, allowing time to discuss the next days events.

!Day 2 - 4th march 2006
{DIV(float=>right)}{img src=show_image.php?id=372 width=400 height=300 desc=\"Elizabeth, Director of Storming Robots\"}{DIV}Day two was even more fun than day one. The show had really brought out many very talented children, who were asking all sorts of questions at the Jama booth. Their interest was clear. Eric spent much time referring inquisitive minds to the ((Lego)) and ((mindstorms)) webpages. Eric and Elizabeth openly shared their ((mindstorms)) knowledge.

Teachers also showed up in droves, and asked many questions.

Eric and Elizabeth did a presentation about her company, \"Storming Robots\", which really got the attention of the kids. This may have been to do with an array of robots she had brought to demonstrate and for the kids to play with and explore. Eric Sophie says - \"The goal of this was to introduce people to the Storming Robots facility where Robo Camps as well as other enrichment programs are held.\"

Eric then did a small presentation on Jama itself. In fact the interest was so high here that they were both swamped. The day was a little longer, and most was spent talking to people. The organizers were clearly happy that Eric and Elizabeth had appeared at the show - giving it a real point of focus for the punters interest.

!People
Elizabeth is the director of Storming Robots, and is very competent with RoboLab, as well as a master builder herself. 
Eric is a master Lego builder, and a regular poster on Lugnet. He will be teaching Building Classes at the Storming Robots facility on Saturdays.
Rebecca is the programme manager (as in event programmes, not as in software engineering) for Storming Robots.

IDLE - International Day Of ((Lego)) Enthusiasts, has been proposed to take place on the 18th March, by an aspiring ((Lugnet)) poster, Tony Alexandre. 18th March is apparently the day after St Patricks day, and for some results in days off in lieu (though many of us, me included, don\'t have that luxury). This year, the day is a Saturday, so you wouldn\'t need to book it off.

The concept is that you simply go to your favourite comfortable building place, with creature comforts, like soft drinks and music, and then build - whatever you like. 

I, for one, will most certainly be enjoying it, and it is great to have an excuse (not that one is really needed too much) just to take time out and do that. However, Tony Alexandre may want to have it recognised as a mid-year day off in a period where there are not many of them, so maybe next year I will book the day as well.

As I am some way through my lathe build (yes I am building a lathe with mostly Lego and some non-Lego cutting components), it would be interesting to spend the day continuing that.

I will post any interesting photos of my WIP builds, presuming I remember to take some while putting it together.

I also would like to draw the Make magazines attention to this day - as I am sure they would find it as noble an idea as I do. So to builders/makers/AFOLS everywhere, Lego or not - take the 18th day of march and enjoy it!

It is updated regularly, and has made a number of interesting observations about the kit and bot itself.

I will certainly be reading it, and of very great interest is the most recent announcement: [http://thenxtstep.blogspot.com/2006/03/back-from-vacation-and-mdp.html]

The author, Jim K, of Atlanta, has been accepted into the ((MDP)). So we may expect to hear much more interesting info from him. There are already a number of tasty tidbits about the system there.

Coupled with [http://legoeducation.typepad.com/], which is an official ((Lego)) blog which I have referred to before, and [http://news.lugnet.com/robotics|Lugnet Robotics], there is a growing surge of information, and very likely a coming surge of interest in robotics at its release as was evident with the original ((RCX)).

Stayed tuned - its all about to get very much more interesting.

It is being held in the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Dallas, Texas. 

If you didn\'t already know, micromouse is about maze solving robots, and the prize goes to those which can solve and get through the maze in the quickest times. This has come from very humble beginning, where it was lucky if a robot made it through, to the modern situation, where a Japanese contestants robot was said to be pulling 1g. 

The contest is judged, and cash prizes are awarded. As this is the 20th anniversary, there will be much larger cash prizes - in the region of USD500 , USD250, and USD125 . Enough to get many contestants interested. There is also a trophy - which would be great for the bragging rights.

I remember seeing an early micromouse competition at one of the Megalab events in the NEC, Birmingham, UK around 11 years ago - it would have been televised on the BBC Program Tomorrows World. 

The rules, summarised are that a robot is awarded points for getting as far as they can through the maze in the shortest possible time. A bonus is given for no human intervention, and penalties are given depending on the length of time taken mapping and not moving. Extra cash prizes are given for actually reaching the centre of the maze. These have largely remained unchanged for many years, something which allows them to continually draw competitors. This is hailed by David Otten of MIT as one of the most attractive aspects of the contests.

You can imagine the usual bunch of students from infamous universities as well as hobbyists and small clubs.

I would love to attend, but I am going to be in London, UK, and will keep up with events via the internet. I am not currently aware of any television coverage for this event, but there may be a webcast, and at least photo coverage from some of the teams own websites.

If you don\'t know what the VeX is, it is like the ((Lego)) ((Mindstorms)) ((RIS)), but with Meccano (thats Erector to US readers) pieces, a much more extensible and flexible ((microcontroller)), a remote control and a whole bunch of well put together motors and sensors. There were also many expansion sets.

Have a look at [http://www.engadget.com/2005/03/23/new-radio-shack-vex-robotics-kits/|Engadgets Blog], [http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/robots/radio-shack-vex-robotics-design-system-036934.php|Gizmodo] as well as the discussions on our own [tiki-view_forum_thread.php?forumId=5&comments_parentId=169|forums] about the kits.

I thought this is fantastic, I can add yet another robot kit and controller to my collection.  But I was to be very disappointed. It appears that Radio Shack does not even ship to the Uk. Stockists in the Uk like Farnell, RS and Maplin don\'t have the kit in their lines. I even tried to contact Radio Shack and see if they knew where I could get it, and given a week they still didn\'t respond.

I really want to get one of these before they disappear. I know that sooner or later they will start appearing on ((eBay)), but I am hoping to grab one in the next month or so, to fill the gap while I am waiting for the ((NXT)).

So this is a question to my readers - do any of you know where I can find it in the Uk? 
Better still at the discount prices they are being sold on Radio Shacks own website at?
Please post comments with what you know, UK stockists, or overseas ones who are prepared to ship to the UK, or just general comments on the VEX (And alternatives) are welcome.

The water leaves nice straight edges clean cuts on the polycarbonate, and as long as you have thought out your template well, taking into account the width of the stream (apparent 0.4inches - that is about 10.2 mm to us), will produce some great parts.

The writer of the make article actually works for a company with this machine, and created a mobile phone holder with it. Sadly - it looks like the website of the company [http://www.bigbluesaw.com] is now slashdotted, probably due to the massive interest in people getting parts. Do not despair - there are plenty of companies who will cut parts for you from plans.

The great thing about this company, when their web servers stop burning, is that they accept many part formats, and the make blog demo was performed with all free software under Linux. He used the GIMP - a common photo and imaging package for manipulating the logo, and Qcad, an open source 2D cad package for building the actual cutting template itself.

These techniques will come in handy when building a robot chassis. Polycarbonate is a very lightweight yet relatively strong material, and featured a great deal in ((Robot Wars)). However, cutting it and working with is generally considered a bit of a pain.

Its annoying, and you computer appears to grow it too.

I was going through my computer, trying to find a document, but because it had not been in any way version controlled (with something like Subversion), there were a few editions, variations and copies. In fact, many of my documents have ended up like that, along with my photo collection and even some of my stored music. This accumulated rubbish was really annoying me. I didn\'t know which duplicate I should take as the master, or for that matter how many duplicates were simply wasting disk space, and were going to come back and haunt me with a reversion to a change I had made on another copy.

So I was looking at building a python script to find, and list duplicate files. This was during my internet drought period brought on by a misbehaving broadband company, and progress was slow, because while the lint annoyed me, it was not enough for me to make this a high priority project. 

So, on the day I got internet back, the first thing I did was Googled to see what was out there, and I came across a rather neat tool named fslint. FSlint does what it says on the tin - it finds the lint on your FileSystem (FS). It find duplicates (by name or more importantly size), and it can also find temporary files, as well as empty dirs and badly named files. 

FSLint is a gnome based GUI app, so it is relatively easy to use. Funnily enough, it was also written with python. At this point I abandoned my attempts, and used this, and to be fair it is pretty good. I don\'t think it does a real byte by byte comparison, it would be nice if it did a simple first few bytes to be a bit cleverer, but its good enough, and it meant it took only a few minutes to clean up what I had. As its python on gnome, it can probably be easily ported to run on windows and a mac, I was running it on Linux, so no problems there.

FSLint also has a command line client, and is licensed under the GPL, so its free, and its code can be retrieved. It is very adaptable and scriptable. If I ever have an itch to deal with more duplicates, I may even enhance it with the ability to compare the first few bytes.

Enjoy it!

Having been to a couple of events myself, I have taken some rather grainy bad mobile phone shots there - [http://orionrobots.co.uk/tiki-browse_gallery.php?galleryId=13|Dorkbot Gallery]. It was great to meet up with other people who have crazy ideas they want to build, and to swap and bounce concepts off each other as well as have a few beers over it. Some of the ideas I have seen are a presentation on a Swarovski Crystal Chandelier with ((LED)) displays in them, which can be texted with messages to display by party goers at an event, or a wall which interacted with the occupants of a room space, and encroached or made space for those inside to move into. The most useful idea was an alarm clock, which used ((Perl)) ((screen scraping)) technology to get train times (and take into account delays/cancellations if it could), and use that to estimate an optimal wake up time, and then go off them, thus giving extra sleeping time and cutting down on train waiting times. Read [http://orionrobots.co.uk/tiki-view_blog.php?blogId=1&find=Dorkbot|Blogs  withDorkbot] to find more.

The London dorkbot organisers are now preparing to run a summer camp, where people could go take a break for a while with a number of like minded others - a whole few days of tents, beer, crazy ideas. It is one of the few times where you might pack a laptop, soldering iron, and a bunch of components/microcontrollers as well as your toothbrush.

They have not yet fixed a date, or a place, but are saying around the 3rd September (isn\'t that a bit late for summer?), and are considering Devon, Dorking and Slimbridge for the outing.

Their regular events are held around London, generally slightly east. Their next event is Wednesday the 19th, at State 51, which is off Rhoda Street (just up from brick lane). So you can go watch some really interesting geeky stuff for a while, then have a top class curry on the way home.

I seriously recommend this group for anyone who has read O\'Reilly\'s Make Magazine and similar. It can be a bit of a mixed bag, as there are great gadgets, okay ones and sometimes the downright mediocre, but there\'s still always enough to keep me interested.

Although you have been able to order Lego sets online for some time, as well as early Lego Factory, it was still not quite ready for you to design a set and have the parts delivered.

Lego factory at first seemed extremely promising, until it was discovered by users that one model may actually pull in bricks from 6 or 7 standard bags, and that you would have to pay for the whole of each bag even if only one piece was used - these bag palettes were quickly figured out, and users learned to model economically in them.

Lego has recently revised the system, and made it more flexible, with more bricks to choose from, and has now individual by-part pricing instead of bag pricing. The palette is not the complete range, and does not include sophisticated elements like Technic or space parts, but mostly the simple bricks. However it is growing, and this has the interesting feeling of full on user-created-content. It is approaching the point where you can design your excellent Lego model (which you may have modelled before using ((LDraw)) CAD), and then upload it to ((Lego)) to get your design sent to you, as well as sharing that with others. If the wealth of models and sets that people on ((Lugnet)) and ((BrickShelf)) come up with started to see representation, ((Lego)) could suddenly get a huge boost in possibilities.

Personally, I cant wait for most of the full range to get included, especially the Technic side of things with gears, axles, and pins.

It appears that the RadioShack sale on Vex kits was due to the Vex Robotics Design System IP being acquired from RadioShack by Innovation First, who are the original creators of the system. This includes the brand name, as well as the platform.

At present it looks like RadioShack is still selling off vex kits at half price for close out.

\"We plan to stock the full line of Vex products and accessories and will seek additional distribution partners to fully serve the consumer and education markets in the US and abroad.\" said Tony Norman, in a press release. Tony Norman is the CEO and President of Innovation First. Where they will be available for purchase is not yet clear, but will probably become so as this progresses.

Norman continued with \"Weâ€™ll also be stepping up efforts to drive innovation into the product assortment and will offer even more unique parts through the www.vexlabs.com website.\" - which may mean that the already wide range will be extended further giving a very real competitor to the ((Lego)) ((NXT)) platform due out at the end of this summer and already being used now by Beta testers.

The Vex, along with Lego has been used for some time by the ((FIRST)) (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) group for their robotics challenges.

The fun part is that what they do in the middle is up to them.

You get people who build all kinds of mad themed modules, or modules with stairs to lift up balls, modules with conveyors, modules with robot arms and even modules with Lego trains. These normally incorporate various robotic elements, including the ((RCX)), ((Lego Manas|Manas)) as well as Lego trains. New ones will probably include the ((NXT)) too.

Now because all of the modules are standard, they can be linked into a big chain, and because of the simplicity of the design, using any module as a corner module, it can be designed to turn the orientation of the ball travel direction. This means a continuous loop can be set up, which, after accounting for battery times, could just carry on moving balls (as long as modules were not dropping to many). 

This was met with massive innovation, and some really creative stuff was creating. One look at any of the videos of this mesmerising, clattering ensemble of machines which has appeared at a number of ((Lego)) conventions can really explain what all the fuss is about.

If you have missed it - take a look at this quick footage to see what I mean: [http://orionrobots.co.uk/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=17|Overview of a GBC Gathering]

Well, in honour of the obsession this thing ended up creating, one Dave Hurley has now created a website for the concept at [http://www.greatballcontraption.com/]. ~np~T-Shirts~/np~ and Mugs can be bought as well as the site being a source of info, video clips of the things in action and other related material.

Dave\'s site complements Steve Hassenplug\'s pages on the subject (Steve is a ((GBC)) Innovator and was involved in the ((NXT)) at a very early stage), and has footage pulled in from a number of places, as well as video clips of the ((NXT)) from the BotMag article.

It has an accessible coverage of the ((GBC)) standard, so you can get right in, look at some of the others, and the standards and build you own. He includes a set of ((GBC)) and ((Lego)) links, including back to ((Lugnet)) and Steve\'s site. So event organisers can plan how big a space they need for ((GBC)) set ups, the site has a registration form, where you can also give details of how your module operates, its ball throughput and so on. This stops one very fast batch module potentially choking a single pathed module. 

Forums are planned on the site, but as it is still under construction they are not up yet, so I would still recommend using our [http://orionrobots.co.uk/tiki-view_forum.php?forumId=8|Lego Discussion Forum] here at OrionRobots or ((Lugnet)) until then.

At [http://www.greatballcontraption.com/events.html] he has a selection of ((GBC)) events,  which is probably to me the most interesting part of the site. It has coverage of previous events, but might be handy to have a list of upcoming events, and an event registration form so other ((GBC)) events can be announced there.

Overall, its a well presented site, and it is growing. It is about time there was a dedicated site to feed its obsession as opposed to it merely being an interesting niche corner in ((Lego)) robotics.

Enjoy!

This is fantastic for those who are not comfortable with the ((Robolab)) style programming system, especially software engineers who find C much more to their taste.

The release is only a Beta - which means there are bugs to be sorted out before it is a full release, but it includes a full ((IDETool|IDE)) and debugger as well as the stuff required to put the code onto the device. Now the real magic here is that it not only caters for the ((NXT)), but also includes support for programming the ((VEX)) ((microcontroller)), and the ((RCX)). 

The C variant is known as ((RobotC)) and was developed by the Robotics Academy at the ((Carnegie Mellon University)) and is linked with a robotics based programming curriculum. This is also related to the ((FIRST)) group.

Apparently the system deploys a very lightweight platform specific ((VM)) much like ((Java)), and compiles then to this target.

Now this seems fairly cool, as the general idea is to be able to use .net - C# or VB(please use C#!) to program robots. Unfortunately, this is let down heavily by the fact that (and I quote) \"The other thing to clarify is that we have no intention of running our bits on MCSs in general.\" - that is, that the robot will have to be controlled remotely (via whatever protocol it already has) from a Windows machine. 

It is worth noting, that beyond the hype, this announcement is actually on an incremental improvement on previously released stuff, and not a new thing. Still, it has certainly brought to the foreground something which has gone fairly quietly by until now.

It has been made clear that this will (via a remote control method) work with the ((Lego)) ((RCX)), ((NXT)), ((VEX)) and the ((FischerTechnik)) ((Robo Interface)) as well as many others. Now what would be interesting is to know if any  of this (along with the required IO devices) could be ported to smaller platforms like PocketPC\'s and other WinCE/Windows Embedded systems. They can run the .net platform, but I have not had a lot of luck getting that kind of ((IO)) from the devices themselves.

Now if MS were to announce that they could compile down to native bytecode for the MS and let them then run standalone this would be much cooler - maybe in a couple of years that may be the case. Until then, may I suggest robotc (covered in [http://orionrobots.co.uk/tiki-view_blog.php?blogId=1|Beta C Programming Solution For NXT announced]) and ((SDCC)) as alternatives that both use C, and compile to bytecode on multiple targets, with the ((RCX)), ((NXT)) and ((VEX)) on the former, and ((PIC)), ((8051)), ((Atmel AVR)) on the latter.

What is still very cool is that MS are sponsoring Carnegie Mellon University, who are relatively prolific in this field.

A laptop may be considered, but still might be too heavy, and not quite interfacable enough.

Now the [http://gp2x.co.uk/go.pl?A694|GP2X] from ~np~GamePark~/np~ holdings has for some time had a compatible breakout board, which allows the ((Linux)) based device to become a ((USB)) host, that is, a machine which can have ((USB)) devices attached to it as opposed to most ((PDA|PDA\'s)) which may only attach as devices to a host PC. The [http://gp2x.co.uk/go.pl?A694|GP2X] has 4 USB ports when the breakout board is connected.

It may have a little trouble powering the Phidgets, but the breakout board does have a slot for external power. This means that a robot could have a 12v DC supply that is used to power the board. It will probably not cope with being on the same power supply as DC motors and possibly normal servo motors, as they would produce a lot of noise which may not be handled by it.

The breakout board also offers a ((RS232)) ((Serial Data Stream|serial)) port, a ((JTAG)) debugging port and 2 RCA style audio connectors. At a cost (as of August 22nd 2006) of only Â£29.99, thats not bad, but do not forget you would still need to buy the actual [http://gp2x.co.uk/go.pl?A694|GP2X] itself. This is also pretty cheap at Â£124.99. It can be used for games, movie and audio playback, and now also possibly for robot control.

{DIV(float=>right, width=>30%)}{img src=/show_image.php?id=389 width=100%}{DIV}
The unexpanded [http://gp2x.co.uk/go.pl?A694|GP2X] comes with an SD slot for expansion, a single USB port (which may be device only), a TV connector, a headphone socket, and has 64Mb of on board NAND flash memory. Although it does not posess a touch screen, combine it with the breakout board, and you can then add a USB keyboard to interact with it. Because of the form factor of the breakout board, it is not unfeasable to add a ((BlueTooth)) adaptor, and use it to communicate with an ((NXT)). The built in colour display is pretty good, and has a resolution of 320*240. Another cool thing is that it runs on 2 AA batteries, with a battery life of 5-10 hours.

Now programming the [http://gp2x.co.uk/go.pl?A694|gp2x] is simple, as not only is it based on ((Linux)) and therefore fairly hackable, but it also comes with its own ((SDK)) (software development kit), loaded with ((API|API\'s)) to make the device really easy to program. For those familiar with bygone ages, the [http://gp2x.co.uk/go.pl?A694|gp2x] is comparable to the Amiga in terms of getting inside the architecture and really having fun with it.

There are emulators for the Spectrum, Commodore 64, as well as MAME for it, and since it encourages community development we can expect more of those, as well as great software. 

I will certainly be buying both systems, the [http://gp2x.co.uk/go.pl?A694|gp2x] at Â£124.99 and the breakout board at Â£29.99, because with a combined cost of Â£154.98, its a pretty serious device.

It has a few really nifty features, in the form of modules. These include a separate display module, Motor Board, Coloured ((LED|LEDs)), sound box, a resistance sensor, sound sensor, touch sensor and light sensor. The sound playback is also meant to be better than that of the ((NXT)) but I am yet to see that demonstrated.

The company are similar to Revell in the States, and specialise in model aircraft, some tanks, and ships. I personally remember painstakingly putting together one of the huge aircraft carrier models that had.

They seemed to feel that they were fighting a loosing battle with TV, Computer games and the Internet. Some modellers also pointed out that their quality had been in decline, with poor glues, and Umbrol enamel paints. Acrylic paints are generally considered easier to work with.

I suspect that the fact that many ((construction toy|construction toys)) that are reconfigurable and don\'t require glue, such as ((Lego)) and its alternatives, will be giving Airfix a tough competitor. Kids expect toys to be motorized, all singing and all dancing.

Another thing which probably preceded their decline was the decline of the toyshop. Sure, you see Toys \'R Us, and the large Tesco extra stores stock many toys. But neither chains really paid much attention to this part of the market, and the smaller toy shops have been put out of business both by these big chains, along with Games Workshop which also dominates the modelling scene.

Well its a shame to see them go. However, this may not be the end of the road if they are bought by a company who look to continue the line.

The robot kits generally under $100 (or under Â£50), but would need to be shipped from US. Not that its a big problem here in the Uk.

Grippers and manipulators for less than $30 (Â£16), and even one at less than $7.00 (Â£3.50). They have sensor mount turrets, and even a full servo controlled pan and tilt head for a camera.

You can also buy single materials for construction, like drilled plastic plates, straight PVC sheets (or perforated), a selection of brackets and spacers, electronic components, wheels and motors (including pre-modified servos).

If you are not planning on going down the mod salvage route, or even if you are but need some additional materials, these are a great resource, very affordable, very well presented.

Time to get started on adding a grabber to the Tribot. The Tribot with a grabber is one of the demonstrations seen in many of the images on the net in the run-up, along with Alpha-Rex (which I will be building later). 

It was a fairly simple build on top of the touch sensor Tribot, although having seen a version of this with the UltraSonic - the touch sensor seems a bit primitive. I also must admit it is good seeing a sensible use for the [http://www.peeron.com/inv/parts/32072|32072 - Technic Knob Wheel] - a neat way to deliver movement at 90 degrees without the complication and non-compliance of a worm gear. A lot of lash, I will grant, but easy and cheap. Unfortunately, I got no photos of the robot at this stage, and was too enthusiastic, moving right on the the sound sensor.

{CENTER()}{img src=/show_image.php?id=413}{CENTER}
Now to program it I again just followed the tutorial, getting into the swing of things. I run the program, and find it suitably fun..
It is a bit aggressive - and knocks the stand around, almost catching it in the grippers. After it reverses, for no apparent reason, the grippers open on braking. I didn\'t program that behaviour...
After three runs, it breaks - the sensor/grabber module pops off, during the force of the grab. I think power 100% (as suggested) might be a bit much... So I make good my repairs and try the slightly less violent grab (75%)... It also seems the grabbers are a bit low, and occasionally grab the stand for the ball also.

{DIV(float=>left)}{img src=/show_image.php?id=414}{DIV}At first I thought the gripper opening could be down to switching from brake to float, thus loosening the grip - but then in float, I can simply turn the gear and get a good grip on the ball. The motor does make a noise as it opens - so it sounds like an active action. Maybe I should start thinking about checking for those updates.. 

Selecting Help->Online updates should kick things off, although many recent programs like Firefox and iTunes will do this check for you upon starting. Hopefully the update will have an update checking startup built in. This option just loads a link in FireFox, to a download page. I see nothing there related, but may come back at some point for the mini-block and legacy libraries. When I start doing BlueTooth things (all via USB at the moment), I don\'t doubt that I may need the firmware update there..

Ok - time to press on...

!Sound Sensor
{DIV(float=>left)}{img src=/show_image.php?id=415}{DIV}The next thing to add is the sound control, not the UltraSonic, but a simple clap register. It is at this point I would like to start using BlueTooth, but since my BlueTooth USB dongle for the laptop is currently buried under other gadgets somewhere, I will have to give it a miss for now. I will write about it once I find the thing... Not that you could ever have too many gadgets though!

One thing I now have to say in defence of the studless style, is it tends to keep sensors better attached than the studded style would for the same given space. Granted that they are not as rigid, but they seem to look like they would stay on better. After fitting the sound sensor, I am now quite worried about the strain it will put on the non-booted RJ plugs. However - being RJ - they may be fair simple to crimp, and much more easily interfaceable than the older ((Lego)) studded connector.

I started the program, and made the additional change of making it wait for a loud noise to start as well as to grab the ball. Success. The sound sensor is definitely simple to work with in the Robolab system.

!Light sensor
{DIV(float=>right)}{img src=/show_image.php?id=418}{DIV}
The first instruction here in the tutorial (Page 65 in the user guide) has a tricky part of pulling an axle from the axle holes in the bottom of the robot. Since these are a bit stiff, it is my recommendation to take the first part with the bushes out, then leaving one bush in the end, use it as a tool to push the other axle out. As you push it out of the first beam, you should be able to pull it from the other side easily. (See right)

Keep the parts around - it is only a temporary removal. You now have some cable routing fun - I am beginning to get the idea that the cavity behind the ((NXT)) is a good spot, bearing in mind that routing the flat cables from the front there does prop it up some. The slight flexibility of studless builds is actually showing a benefit there.

Oh - and once you have assembled the subassembly, plug it in before locking it in place. It is easier that way around. I am also not happy with the tightness of its fit against the touch sensor - a lot of strain on the connector (see the two images inset above right). Maybe I worry too much, but after years of using RJ plugs and cabling for telephone lines and networking in server rooms, I know that it does go..
!!Programming with the light sensor
With the Light Sensor fitted, I move on to seeing what kind of program challenge is next. I am now starting to get bolder with it, and tackle this one without having a peek at the help. I take the last program as a starting point, save it with a new name and modify it. This is when my laptop screen (1024*768) lets me down as the programming canvas is too small, there is also no zoom out feature. You can scroll with arrow keys or the pan tool, but there are no scroll bars. There is the map view however, in the bottom right corner, which helps a little here - not that the \"Map Tab\" always responds. Sometimes, if you have changed view in the main app, you need to switch to help, then back to map tab for it to actually show you the map after defaulting back to help and not actually setting the control. Others it is just blank.

I did find a short list of community found NXT-G bugs [http://forums.nxtasy.org/index.php?showtopic=178&st=0&#|here], which did mention the Map Tab issue I saw. The reporter recommends switching between that and help a few times. Perhaps ((Lego)) will release a software update to sort that one out. I could not find anything referring to it on ((lugnet)), perhaps the lugnet.dearlego would be a good place to mention the issue.

I had to determine how many revolutions a full turn round would be - I could either do it through trial and error, or another method. My solution was somewhere between. I used a small axle, and an orange Technic tooth, slotting one onto a drive wheel, noting how much they turn for a full two motor spin. This may have been overkill, as I later note that the tutorial program just reverses, then hits 370 degrees.. It did the job close enough though -I got 370 for a result for both wheels. I did a full 180 degree spin on the robot. I also knocked the ball holder clear as unlike the tutorial code, my robot did not back off before spinning.

[http://orionrobots.co.uk/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=30|Download the code]

Amusingly, the sensitivity was good enough that it actually stopped when over one of the black marked out ball holder squares instead of the thick outer black line. A small tweak did the job. I am also beginning to notice that there is no quick key for compile and download.

!Getting Ambitious
I then decided to try build a line follower program for the claw bot in its current state.
This is where I start to use the comment feature. I must admit- a typed language is easier/quicker to move around in, as I am now having to pan a lot to fit my program in, and editing the text of a comment means switching tool, clicking the comment, editing it, and probably repositioning it. In a non-visual language, I just move to the line and type. I also find the variable references awkward, dragging lines. Deleting an erroneous line seems to be eluding me at the moment too. I also seem to have scope problems - I cant get a block inside an if block to reference a variable/value outside itself. Again- getting way ahead of the tutorials. I should slow down here, maybe come back later.

Next in the tutorials will be the Ultrasonic sensor - but you will have to wait...

Today\'s find was Rubot II - The Rubik\'s Cube Solving Robot.

{FLASH(movie=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/jkft2qaKv_o&rel=1\",width=>425,height=>373,quality=>high)}{FLASH}

Rubot II comes from Peter Redmond, who may be familiar as he was also responsible for an old barbecued delicacy, Diotoir! To refresh your memory, Diotoir was a big pink and black spotted furry robot on ((Robot Wars)), which was frequently, and rather inevitably set on fire by either the arena hazards or by ((Sgt Bash)). In fact, this became such a joke that I recall a skewer with vegetables was hung across it so they could be gently grilled as it went up! Diotoir also had big comedy eyes with feminine eyelashes.

Rubot II is a Rubik\'s cube solving robot. That in itself is again something we should have seen coming, and I am sure there are a number of those around, including ((mindstorms)) ones. However, none might come at it with such style and panache as this one. It not only does the job functionally, but looks good too. It has a VF Doom style mask for a start.

The robot first asks a willing participant to take a cube and mix it up, then place it on a tray. It lifts the cube to eye level, and starts it\'s examination. In a brilliant touch of genius, as it starts to work, it starts to play the robots on parade music from the classic film ((Johnny Five|Short Circuit)). It solves the Rubik\'s cube pretty quickly. In this clip, it then shamelessly plugs and asks the viewer to tell their friends.

When the robot speaks, or indeed while it plays the Short Circuit music, it has a display for a mouthpiece which responds to the sounds, in a very classic 80\'s ((SciFi)) robot way. Much like the dashboard of ((Kitt)).

Rubot II was of course preceded by an earlier model, the Rubot I which is shown in its prototype video. Rubot I has not got any of the cool sculpture aspects of its successor, but it still does the job. It is a little clumsier, but the basic principles appear to be the same, even down to much of the jointing of the arms used.

The robots are now homed on a website with all of Peter Redmond\'s creations, [http://www.mechatrons.com]. This website is a bit flashtastic, but the flash is put to good use, even if the \"atmosphere\" music can get a bit repetitive after a short time. The website has a few other robot videos, and promises that there is more to come. It has a few areas that are empty, and may later have links to more information about each of the Bots.

Go take a look at the site, and the video. Good fun.

* [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6960jAGCkiA|University of Michigan - Robot Rubik\'s Cube Solver II] - What I love about this is that you can clearly see the encoder wheels. It is even cooler that is starts performing multiple turns at once on opposing sides. It notably only rotates one way, although this may be true of the other robots too (possibly less clear than here). Rotating only one way has two advantages, first is that cubes can jam going the other way, which would be pretty bad, and secondly, an algorithm that only deals in one turning directions could be simpler (that is only a \"could be\" mind).

	I have still been at work on my Lathe, built with <a href=\"Lego\" title=\"The best known construction toy\">Lego</a>. This is the first in a series of automatic construction/fabrication/workshop robots that I want to build. It has been photographed during it\'s construction, and I will be putting those, along with it\'s plans, onto OrionRobots.</p>
<p>
	I quickly found that the cutting arm, which is where the computerised/robotic intelligence would come in, was actually not the difficult part.</p>
<p>
	The difficult part turned out to be the rotating stage. This is difficult because it needs to be high torque, constant speed rotation. It needs to turn a fairly heavy job, and must be able to grip that job firmly from both ends. One end needed to be adjustable.</p>
<p>
	My initial starts on this were overcomplicated and over engineered. I was trying to make both ends powered, which I then found out is rarely, if ever, the case in other lathes. So I simplified that, and made the adjustable end simply free spinning, using some heavy wheels to conserve its momentum.</p>
<p>
	I am yet to build a chuck, and my crude version (turning polystyrene parts) simply uses three axles as prongs to pierce the job from two sides rather like forks and turn it that way. It is not a very successful strategy, and I may yet have to build a real chuck, somehow with <a class=\"wiki wiki_page\" href=\"Lego\" title=\"The best known construction toy\">Lego</a>.</p>

!!The Lego Microwave
This is a very simple demonstration of the logic behind a microwave, using  ((mindstorms)) parts. Simple, but effective.

!!Lego Elevator
This is a neat little device, demonstrating how the logic behind a lift works with ((Lego)). The first two things that can be noted is that there appears to be only one ((Lego RCX|RCX)), but there are four lift buttons, two light sensors being used for the top and bottom levels, and also a sensor being used with a custom encoder wheel. That makes 7 sensors, and there are only 3 ports - what cleverness is being used to multiplex these? This is actually from the same guy who created the Microwave.

!!Forklift
This is an ((Lego RCX|RCX)) based forklift, which seems to be following a track, and using black bars marked on it to detect when to lower or raise its forks. It is also from the microwave guy. It seems a shame he has no website of his own, or at least has not linked to it from these creations.

!!GBC Loop
I always enjoyed watching ((GBC)) stuff (great ball contraption for the uninitiated). This little loop is pretty cool, and has plenty of different ways of getting the balls form a to b. The great thing about GBC\'s (or worst thing depending on POV) is that they are one of the few machines noisy enough to almost drown out the noise of kids at a convention, as seen in the second vid.

The first vid has one unit which does pretty well at coping with its own spillage. Spillage is an inevitable fact of life when building GBC modules, in that occasionally, ((Lego)) balls will be misplaced and end up outside of the machines..

The last video is a treat for those who like this stuff, and trains, with a train forming a part of the ball chain.

!!Ernie
But the best have to be the films of \"Ernie\" - an Eight Legged ((Lego)) robot, using only one ((Lego RCX|RCX)). It seems to have two sets of legs each powered by one motor. My only worries are that the legs appear a bit thin, but with so many, the weight should be well distributed, and also that there is a horrible grinding just as the legs are about to touch ground... It is interesting to note that there is a multiplexer board on the top there - maybe the \"Passive Sensor Multiplexer\" from [http://mindsensors.com/index.php?module=pagemaster&PAGE_user_op=view_page&PAGE_id=21|Mindsensors]?

Ernie has a home at [http://www.smittysbricks.com/?page_id=5|smittysbricks.com], although I have not determined who the creator Smitty is..

I just want to remind my readers, that our [http://orionrobots.co.uk/tiki-page.php?pageName=OrionRobots%20store|OrionRobots Store] is now open. We have books, computer games and DVDs related to robotics, as well as ((Lego)), ((Meccano)) and tools for the older builders. I am sure there are a few things there to interest a robot enthusiast for Christmas.

!Tags
{TAGS()}robots Lego store GBC howstuffworks{TAGS}","title": "Lego machines group on YouTube","postId": 127}, {"FROM_UNIXTIME(created)": "2007-01-27 08:18:51","data": "The Register is an internet publication I regularly read which discusses technology and other areas of interest from an editorial point of view. It is not always the most accurate and impartial place to read things, but it is often quite fun and interesting. I have been on a reading spree and come across a number of articles that I think are somewhat relevant in robotics.

Some of the most fun ones are those based upon reader questions, which can sometimes live up to the adage of \"ask a silly question, get a silly answer\", but can sometimes be insightful and informative. These have all been stumbled upon.

!Will Robots Ever Be Like Humans?
* [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/12/23/the_odd_body_robots/]
This is interesting because it actually cites a number of sources. The main gist of the answer is not so much about the ((AI)) development but more the actual physical body structure. I would suspect that having human like dexterity and suppleness may actually be closer than having human like intelligence. 

Effectively and adaptably controlling so many actuators may require a vaster intelligence and ((servo motor)) control than artificial intelligence currently offers, however, much like the ((Honda)) ((Asimo)) in the current adverts, it could be preprogrammed with a few very lifelike activities.

!Is an artificial eye close to reality?
* [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/11/24/the_odd_body_artificial_eye/]
This is actually an article covering a number of small questions with short answers and citations to back them up. The actual concept of an artificial eye is not new, and students have been known to perform activities using electrodes and grids of light sensors.

While these basics have shown some use, and have even been used by blindfolded students to navigate a maze, more advanced ((CCD|CCD\'s)) (the kind of technology used in every mobile phone camera and webcam) have become very common and cheap. With some additional processing, they could be used. However, I also think this arrangement is not enough to constitute an \"eye\". An adjustable focus wide angle lens, with varying detail bands, and a system to allow it to be moved (not fixed position) would make a simple ((CCD)) more eye-like.

!!Can colours be detected by touch
Another question answered in this article is if colours can be detected by touch. Now while that seems not only unlikely, but probably impossible, in certain light conditions, the reflected vs absorbed heat may be a rough indicator of the shade of the colour on the item.  Most people have experienced touching a matt black item that was that much hotter than its surroundings on a hot summer day. Unlikely, but also more plausible than any \"psychic\" explanations.

The Register have cited a reference to a lady who believes she can do this. Of course, it is very likely that most people who claim this are little more than elaborate (and not always so elaborate) hoaxes.

!20 Questions
* [http://www.20q.net/]
I don\'t know if I mentioned this site before, but I stumbled on it years a go, and stumbled upon it again today when looking for a herb identification key on line (which I did not really find). 20 questions is a database based upon question-answer responses, and it can identify what you are thinking about, a variation on the animal, mineral, vegetable game if you like.

It is actually fairly astute, and can guess most things within 20 questions. It is a little fickle, as it learns from its players, you may find your answers contradict those of \"most players\" - which do not necessarily mean you are wrong, but in a way, learning to identify it as most players see it is probably more valuable. They also sell a 20q gadget which can be used to impress people with a little bit of AI trickery.

It is also a bit of good harmless fun. 

!Mechanical Turk
* [http://mturk.com]

This is a rather odd and amazing concept. It is the idea of offering an ((API)) that allows you to set tasks that an ((AI)) is not yet capable of, like identifying objects in photographs, and for those who perform such tasks, an opportunity for a quick mini-earner. It is not a lot, normally measured in cents, and for non-US people it earns Amazon vouchers. 

The system is currently a Beta, run by Amazon. I have played with it, and think it is a concept that could be very handy for tagging and creating a lot of metainformation, thus creating the \"semantic web\". Link concepts like this with the 20q engine - and you have a powerful expert system involving people as well as machines.

It is actually named after an infamous 18th century chess machine, which appeared to play a really good game, but turned out to be a man curled up, a great hoax. This was known as the Turk, and by facilitating tasks that people would like a computer to be able to do, MTurk creates an automated way of linking up capable humans with tasks required by others or even by machines.

Now I had the ((NXT)) software installed, it was time to fire it up. I was expecting an all singing, all dancing presentation as was the case with the ((RCX)) ((RIS)) and Mars Mission software, but those kind of intro movies seem to have withered away. They did add an element of excitement to Lego toys though. This instead fires up a rather good looking interface, which has a rounded, flattened and simplistic style reminiscent of LCARS (the Star Trek UI).

Time to click the \"Getting started\" button. The software rapidly runs through a little presentation demo, and tells me I can now connect my NXT to download a program. I plug it in, turn it on connected and Windows detects it. I then click the next button on the presentation, already a step ahead - as usual, jumping the gun. It then tells me to plug in the cable, already ahead. 

The presentation goes through uploading the program and tells me now to press enter four times to take me to the Demo program. I give it a go and realise it has not actually uploaded anything, just shown me a movie..

Okay...So I go back, and actually try it out as the presentation suggests with the interface - which dismisses the presentation. Wait a minute! I want to try it out, right now, but I want to be able to go back. Actually, it is fairly simple. There is a tabbing interface. The thing is, this initial tab is indicated only with a single icon, so it looks like it should do something else. All the program tabs have the program names. Anyone using Firefox will soon find their way around the tabs.

{BOX(float=>left, width=>320px)}{img src=/show_image.php?id=412}
Tea & Robots{BOX}I start programming with a drag and drop, push the download button, press the orange button on the NXT four times, and I hear the sound \"Good Job\". 

I will have to play with the NXT-G drag and drop interface for a while, and see what it is really capable of, but I will probably be throwing a C compiler or ((Lejos)) on it so I can port old familiar algorithms to the NXT.

Time to go start on the robo centre. I click on the Tribot and click through, noting that the paper instructions are shown in a small window pane on the screen. The pane is not expandable via dragging, but there is a zoom button. I am glad there were paper instructions - it is not that easy to see on my small laptop screen, and I can move much faster with the paper ones. I Note that there is an artefact at the end of the digital instructions that you will need to test with - which is available on the paper ones on page 60 of the User Guide.

I built the ball holder, needed for trying out the next few things, it is on page 60 of the User Guide, or at the end of the digital tribot instructions. 
!First Program
{BOX(title=>New Parts, float=>right, width=>150px)}{img src=/show_image.php?id=411 width=150}When building this I noticed this new piece, a rubber part with two axle holes, the [http://www.peeron.com/inv/parts/45590|45590 - Technic Axle Joiner Double Flexible] according to ((Peeron)). This may be handy if motor vibrations interfere with the Ultrasonic sensor.{BOX}Time to create the first program, okay not quite the first, but I am not sure I count the \"Well Done\" demo. This basically went forward and back. After downloading it - the robot seems to veer immediately to its left. I remove my added Ultrasonic sensor ([/tiki-view_blog_post.php?blogId=1&postId=131|Last blog post]- I jumped the gun again), tried again in case that was the cause. It is returning to the same spot, but at a different angle.

I try it on 5 seconds off the pad- and the veer does not seem to be an issue. I weight down the pad - and it returns fine - it seems that on the laminate floor, the pad is kicked away at an angle as the robot sets off. My advice is to weigh it down with something so it doesn\'t slip around.

Okay- 2.3 seconds forward and back isn\'t that exciting... It is also this point which I notice that it does not self power down... I try to find the NXT settings in the UI in Windows and cannot see it - but there is a settings menu on the brick itself. For now - 2 minutes of inactivity will do fine.

!Adding a touch sensor
{DIV(float=>left)}{img src=/show_image.php?id=410}{DIV}The next build is a touch sensor for the bot. One other thing I have noticed with this set, is that the axles seem to put up much more resistance than they do in my older sets. 

The routing instructions in step 6 of the Tribot Touch sensor are a bit useless both on screen and on paper (step 23, page 53) - note that it actually intersects geometry at the front of the diagram. I had a bit of fun there trying to find a place that would not stress the unbooted RJ connectors, and also not crimp the cables or stress liftarms by placing them under things. These larger leads are a bit awkward. 

The program worked well, but not without flicking the block a little way from its spot as it reversed - a bit of a kick. Not a lot I can do about that at this point.

Time for the grabber - when things start getting interesting...

For us, 2006 was a busy year, with the lathe project still in progress, the site refresh which is now nearing completion (I think you will like it!), and me gearing up to open a store front, then I held off on the ((NXT)) so I could finish other things. I new that as soon as I tore it open that I would be able to set my mind on little else. I had registered to join the ((MDP)), but wasn\'t among those picked. So after waiting a long while, a little too long, OrionRobots finally acquired one of these babies. There were a couple of delivery issues, having ordered it in the buildup for Christmas, but the ((Lego)) Shop@Home guys soon cleared it up.

!Opening up
I rather eagerly opened it up, and put the free Duracell batteries to good use elsewhere, installing the rechargeable battery I had bought, and already got charged. One amusing observation is that although Shop @ home ship free Duracell, the ((mindstorms)) website recommend Energizer batteries.

!Trying it out
Connecting all the motors and sensor to the brick, I started it up, approving the cute sound, and started the tests. Kind of mixed results to be fair. I was a little disappointed with the light sensor, which is marketed as \"detects different colours\" - it is actually simply detecting light intensity, as the ((RCX)) light sensor did, and does not compare with the ((HiTechnic Light Sensor)), which uses three different colour sensors. The NXT light sensor can effectively differentiate many colours though, especially those of its two primary coloured playing balls.

The motor rotation sensors accuracy impressed me - after putting a nice long beam on it, I could accurately position it to the degree and have it detect it. Not bad. I did not test how much drift there is after a few rotations, and perhaps I should do.

The Ultrasonic sensor is unfortunately just in my range of hearing, but then I am a bit awkward like that. It is by far the most interesting, although its sensitivity at close distances really drops off. Anything closer than about 7cm is generally reported as being at 5cm, full stop.

!Start here
{DIV(float=>right)}{img src=/show_image.php?id=409}{DIV}
Having so far ignored the \"Start here\" box, and thumbed around the instructions a little to try it out, I start
constructing the robot detailed there. It is a shame ((Lego)) still have not got Dark Grey and Black differentiated well enough - I did start off by looking for a black piece for the third step before cottoning on. In the inventory lists - it s not so clear as in the construction diagrams. This is something I have also observed with ((LDraw)) work. 

After about 20 minutes, it was ready to go. I will admit that I am still not entirely cool with the studless building technique, but I am sure it will become second nature now. I do have the 8436 truck to add some more of the studless beam parts in should I need them for later models.

This little basic robot is not a bad little basic platform to get started. I took the liberty of adding the Ultrasonic sensor connected to the front of the robot, a step I expect to pop up later. 

I then started the Demo program to put it through a test, and quickly found that I had connected the motors the wrong way by jumping the gun and connecting them one-for-one instead of following the directions in step 20. I got this all working, and watched it go through the demo. Not bad. I am not sure if it is meant to end up at the same spot - but it didn\'t.

!Onboard Programming
There is an onboard \"programming\" facility, which allows 5 simple steps to be entered. It is really a bit too basic to be of much use, and I think a little more could have been done. Still - it allowed me to program a basic response the the Ultrasonic sensor.

!Software
I then started the software install on a candidate laptop. I unfortunately received a \"can\'t install BlueTooth backup\" error, which may be because I did not currently have my BlueTooth dongle plugged in - I noted it, had a quick look at the web page, but left this one for later and pushed on. I also forsee a few software updates once it is installed - I know that ((Lego)) have made firmware revisions already. 

I register the software, and continue the installation of the drivers, which unfortunately prompts an annoying Windows habit of forcing me to restart before I can carry on. After the restart, it does a little more with a flash update (why is it always only \"US\" English?), and the icon is there on my desktop..

And I am going to leave you there so I can go play with it.. I have plans - I have a BlueTooth camera phone, and a BlueTooth Pocket PC - which has Wi-Fi and is just about the right size for a robot. I see some very interesting robots to come... I still have to finish the lathe, but only after trying out the NXT properly!

Can I also remind our readers that we now have a [/tiki-page.php?pageName=OrionRobots%20store|Store] open with many robot related and gadgety items.

{TAGS()}NXT RCX Lego Mindstorms Robots{TAGS}","title": "OrionRobots gets our first NXT","postId": 131}, {"FROM_UNIXTIME(created)": "2007-02-20 11:02:30","data": "If the current interest shown by the US Military in flying ((UAV)) fighters is fruitful, then the manned fighters and bombers may become a thing of the past.

This has many implications. Of course, the oldest argument about fighters loosing their cockpit jobs will be the first, although to be fair, any development that takes humans out of a dangerous situation is generally a good one. That would however mean that those who enjoy such high adrenaline exercises may have to find other ways to satisfy such a need.

Also implied is the idea of putting a robot behind a gun. While these are not intelligent machines, and a long shot from ((The Terminator)), it is still a thought that disturbs many. Of all the uses we could put robots to, why is this one seriously considered? As already stated, it removes humans from the cockpit danger zone, and therefore, by lowering the adrenaline of what is probably going to be a remote pilot situation more than an AI situation, then the decisions taken may be more accountable. 

Recent press given to the accidental shooting of British Troops by US pilots bring to mind what kind of mistake could be prevented by troops being more cool, and also by being in better communication by piloting UAV\'s from base. It could mean better targeted strikes, and since a UAV is more expendable, then missions that succeed in the face of AA ordinance that would otherwise have had to have been aborted.

What makes a difference now more than ever, is that these UAVs will be cheap. Without the engineering constraints needed to support a human inside the cockpit, the cost of the flying machines may actually be less than a manned one. With a single pilot being able to command multiple robot units, this also results in a significant cost saving.

A robotic flying vehicle fleet would be as useful for searching for survivors, bringing in supplies, as it would for aerial attacks, defending a location and providing covering fire.

I have realised that I need to rebuild the bed and the headstock, as my initial design involved a driven headstock and tailstock, which turned out to be too complicated, but the vestige is a headstock driven from a drive system in the middle of the bed via three axles distributing the high torque expected. This unfortunately is in just the right place to pick up the kerf from the part being turned. It uses two Technic gear motors joined by a differential to drive the headstock, and I expect to keep much of the torque system similar when I do the<br />
	rebuild. The bed also needs to be bigger - having been resized upwards twice already. The four jaw chuck turned out to be much larger than I expected.

","title": "Welcome to 2007!","postId": 128}, {"FROM_UNIXTIME(created)": "2007-01-23 15:42:27","data": "I am now well underway with my work on the NXT. I have built and programmed the grabber bot, and have it driving to and picking up a ball on command via hand claps. 

I had a brief play with NXT-G to see if I could program a light/dark line follower, but ended up a little frustrated with variables and scope, and decided to carry on through the tutorials, and try again later when I have more NXT-G experience. After all, the only other similar language I used was ((RCX)) code, and pretty much mostly used ((NQC)) for my ((RCX)) programming. Despite not being a fan of these kind of languages, I am determined to get the hang of NXT-G coding before falling back to the more familiar comforts of c.

!Adding the Ultrasonic sensor to Tribot
Now next in the tutorial is adding an Ultrasonic sensor. This is where we are really stepping beyond what the ((RCX)) was able to do with the (unexpanded) RIS, and start getting some of the new stuff.

{DIV(float=>right)}{img src=/show_image.php?id=419}{DIV}First a little bit of building - I can see a lot of design went into making this bot modular and expandable. I appreciate that somewhat. For the step pulling out an axle, you may find it easier to use another axle to push it through initially. You don\'t need to pull the axle all the way out, just enough for the gap between the beams in the middle to be clear. I also chose to use the much shorter cable for this, as there was no need to the 35 cm one. I found that as the bottom of the sensor was not secured - it seems to look up under the weight of the cable. I placed an additional bush-pin in to secure it (inset).

!Programming it
I decided to follow the beaten trail here, and work within the tutorial. I did however work in metric not inches, and spotted the rather nice conversion feature. If you type a value in inches into the Ultrasonic distance value, then switch units, the NXT programming interface will convert for you. I also used the value 0.4 for the closing of the arms, so they were not quite so violent, but then had a neater idea - 90 degrees is enough to open them. I also find the way they do the turning here, and in the light sensitive code to be quite unusual. My light sensor code use both wheels in opposite directions - turning on a penny...

!Out of memory
Anyway- after completing the program, I found the ((NXT)) was out of memory, and had to clear a few things from it. The memory manager only showed me the \"good job\" sound, to clear. I did not see any NXT code uploads to clear though in it - how strange. I then noted that the percentage bar had a clickable \"program\" area. This showed all the programs I had loaded in. While browsing this, the NXT timed out and shut off - and the display just cleared. You would think that keep-alive messages would be sent to the nxt while using this dialogue. At least for a while..

The Touch sensor and grabber programs were using a rather large 12Kb each. Now I know using embedded c on my day job that you can build whole suites of quite complex software in 12k - there were only about 9/10 blocks, so those must expand to quite a lot of code. I suspect the blocks in the \"Common Blocks\" tab are very high level blocks of many more blocks. I wander if it is the number of blocks, or the number of different types of blocks which contributes to size - this would be down to how much is duplicated, and how much is simply referenced. Something to investigate later.

Clearing a whole bunch of my programs left 55.5Kb free. Should be more than enough to keep on going.

!Testing this code
I cleared my test pad, bar a few paperweights in the corners, ensuring that there was enough clearance for the Ultrasonic not to pick up anything (since it was 50cm, I cleared 80+). It ran OK. I have to admit, the tutorials turning made it look more natural than my two motor spin.

My degrees thing works, but it has the proviso that if the arms are not open far enough, it will not reach 90 degrees and then stop. Maybe a more complex block (to come later) would be a good move - IE to turn the motor until it stops turning. This is probably why Lego chose a time in seconds instead.

!What now?
This seems to be all of the vehicles section in the Robo Center. There is a picture of 4 wheeler on the thing, but no four wheeler in the section - so far only the Tribot. I don\'t know it this could be expanded with a SWF presentation of something to add additional robots in for teaching purposes, and I know this has been mentioned by other blogs. Drawing your own digital instructions would probably involve using ((LDraw)) at the moment, and ((LPub)) to create images from the LDraw instructions, then placing those into an SWF movie.

I am really not entirely done with the Tribot. Although I will disassemble it to try the other tutorials, I will probably build it again to try some ideas of my own - it is not a bad simple little platform to play with and code on.

!Machines
The next tempting section is machines with an arm. This is looking exciting. I am going to go build them now, and report later. Come back and read about it.

I have (as some astute readers may have noticed) been updating some of the older blog stories to fit with the new format, and also, as I do every now and again, have been looking at my options for CMS systems. I would like to get a blog story summary page, and also an archive system, and to streamline some parts of the site with Perl. So expect some good changes to the site, which will hopefully enhance user experiences and navigation.

It uses only two motors and one light sensor to sort five different colours of gum balls, and was created by youTube user bubkas22.

There is a hopper that is filler with balls (not shown in shot), and then a single motor powers a ball release mechanism. It uses the light sensor to determine the colour, then moves across to the correct column. The same ball release mechanism releases that ball from the sensor chamber into the column, while releasing the next ball from the hopper into the sensor chamber.

It is all quite smooth, although I suspect using only the light sensor - which is sensitive to intensity and not colour itself, then some shades of colours may confuse it completely.

Anyway - enjoy!

</div>Of all the things to happen in the next decade or so, Virgin actually launching their commercial space service may be one of the most influential. 

Our dreams in the 80\'s of the last few years being a decade of space travel (as many SciFi series, not least those of Gerry Anderson, foretold) have been on the whole not realised, and space travel has so far proven to be expensive, dangerous and unreliable. This may be as much to do with the operators responsible for it as the problem domain itself. So far it has been almost exclusively in the hands of government or military run organisations and only for research projects. The only real commercial usage has been the launching of satellites, the launches of which are still unreliable and relatively expensive.

If space flight becomes more commercial and market driven, costs will be driven down, and ))SpaceShipTwo(( has already demonstrated how much cheaper it is than conventional space rockets per launch. As I mentioned in an earlier article, the plans for space hotels are beginning to be realised too. I look forward to the next decade as being the one where space travel will actually become more than merely a pipe dream.

As you may (or may not know), I am myself an ((AFOL)) or Adult Fan Of Lego. For those who like Lego but are unaware how much their hobby is shared, be sure to go and find out about ((Lugnet)) - the Lego Users Group Network. Lugnet is an internet community all about sharing and enjoying the Lego hobby, and has specialist groups for robotics, technic, building ((mecha)), build houses, trains, spaceships and all sorts of other stuff. There are even conventions (although I am yet to make it to one) where people display their amazing ((Lego)) creations.

I own a rather large amount of Lego, what is in fact my second collection. I started building Lego kits as a kid, and had a big mixture of technic and space Lego, which I abandoned when I thought I was old enough to leave alone. My sisters scattered most of that collection to the four winds.

A few years later, after the introduction of ((mindstorms)) and specifically the ((RCX)) which my University faculty had tried to acquire, I bought this kit and was hooked again. I rebuilt my collection with a combination of new purchases, and handy buys from ((eBay)) and ((BrickShelf)). I now own the ((RCX)), ((Cybermaster)), ((Manas)), a ((SpyBotics)) kit, plenty of space Lego, some bumper boxes of generic bricks, plenty of pneumatic kit as well as the amazing ((NXT)), all of which demonstrate that Lego are still innovating in the construction toy market, and it is all mostly backwards compatible. 

For the purists, remember that the studless beams still can act as sockets for normal studs and are compatible with all the technic pins.

These days, I would never again give up my Lego, and although it takes up a reasonable section of my storage, it is one of my prized possessions.

However, one bright young chap in Michigan, US has been busy building or converting his own EV\'s. 

Andrew\'s first project was to convert a 1988 Mazda pick-up truck into an EV. Albeit not the most effective one with a range of 40 miles per charge and a top speed of 55Mph. But the builder is 16 years old. If he is starting here, it is pretty clear Andrew is going to go far. He is now on a second project which is converting a 1992 Toyota Tercel. 

He has been blogging every step of the way. Given the number of old cars which end up in the scrapheap, this is a really good way of reusing stuff that would otherwise have been thrown away. With hobbyists like Andrew Angelloti starting to build EV\'s, it is likely a healthy home build tinkering hobby will encourage much more investment in EV\'s than the slightly disinterested big motor companies have managed to muster so far.

Now having real ones on Nano Scale is still quite a distance away, however, a team at ((Carnegie Mellon University)) led by Seth Goldstein have come up with some demonstration robots which use a ring of electromagnets around their perimeter to bind and move around each other. The goal is to create the microscopic swarming robots eventually, and small electrical charges instead of magnets are likely to be more efficient at that scale.

These demonstrations of robots has been dubbed \"claytronic\". NewScientist created a video of this demo in action.

People have asked a number of times who I am influenced by and why.

I don\'t go for glitz and glamour, but for real achievers that one way or another have made real differences, often in technology and science, and often being unrecognised while doing so. They all have real human failings, and some have sides that I feel less inclined to like, but still admire them for their achievements.

!!So who are they?

Albert Einstein - Top of my list comes this amazing man. He has single handedly done so much for modern physics. He spent a reasonable amount of his life unrecognised, and sadly saw his equations used to create atomic weapons. However, for understanding fundamentals of light, energy and particle physics, he has done much.

Alan Turing - Like a number of these great people, society did not accept his choices and drove him to a sad demise. It must be acknowledged that without this man, modern computing and programming systems would not be what they are. Again, he had some very human failings and I am aware that his theories were developed in War Time for intercepting and decrypting messages. 

Nikola Tesla - Nikola Tesla remained largely unrecognised throughout his life, but modern electromagnetic machines, including simple AC power transmission, the electrical transformer, generator and motor systems, induction based power systems, robotics and a great deal more are due to his work in this field. There are quite possibly plenty of discoveries he made that the rest of the world are yet to discover and understand. He died with no money and commonly regarded as a mad scientist.

((Charles Babbage)) - The machines designed by Charles Babbage are fairly well known as concepts for large mechanical computing machines, the most well known being the difference engine. A working machine has been constructed and is now on display in the Science Museum in London.

These are but a few, but a very important few, of my influences. There are many other names I should mention in brief which include inventors, entrepreneurs and writers - Galileo, Copernicus, Pythagorus, Tim Berners-Lee, ((Leonardo Da Vinci)), Linux Torvalds, Mark Shuttleworth, Steven Hawkings, Richard Dawkins, Douglas Adams, ((Isaac Asimov)) and Terry Pratchett.

Of course, not all the people I consider role models are famous. Other people I consider great role models are my father who is also a software engineer, and some very good friends of mine who exceptional people as well as exceptional technologists.

I hope that some people may read this, follow up a little on the people mentioned here, and maybe be inspired themselves to do similar great things.

It is a tiny box - about the size of router, maybe a little taller. It has a wireless aerial at the back, a set of lights on the front, an Ethernet port, power socket and a cavity for an IDE hard drive inside it. The box also has one USB2 port which can play as a USB2 host. That already gave me ideas - I know it can support USB2 drives, but how about a DVD Burner for backups directly from the NAS, or connecting my printer to it? Well early days yet...

This is where it starts to get fun. I bought a 250Gb hard drive for the cavity and let the drive start up and initialise the drive. Immediately it grabs an IP address via DHCP my local network and starts whirring away. The manual gives details on finding an initialising it for my network so I can give it a permanent address.

Initially the box shares the drive as a windows share, and has a web interface to edit the settings, although this interface has a couple or quirks that mean it only works in Internet Explorer. The interface allows me to set up users and access restrictions, enable FTP access and other small operations as well as monitoring the health and temperature of the drive. 

!Hackable
However, I bought this device for more than just storing files. This box has a hacking community around it, and under the hood it is simply a Linux kernel running the busybox set of tools built with uclibc on flash storage. The drive is actually partitioned into one great big Ext2 Linux partition. Don\'t worry if that does not yet mean a lot to you - what it simply means is that this box is hackable, and could possibly be used for an SBC - Single Board Computer.

The hardware consists of a 170Mhz PowerPC based processor, 32MB of RAM and 4MB of Flash ROM. This may sound limited, but it is a tiny cheap box, and now probably has a huge hard drive attached to it! It may be perfect for a tiny home server sitting in the corner.

The drive as its shared can have a single file placed on it named \"fun_plug\". This harmless seeming name allows you to do something quite interesting - it is a shell script, running in a busybox equivalent of a Bourne Unix shell. You can run commands from this script. It runs every time the box is restarted. The next step is to get some of my own tools on the box so I can run those.

I have had it long enough to have done plenty with the box, and will be blogging my hacks so far with it here. I will give you the links to start you off though..

{CENTER()}{AMAZONSELFOPTLINK(pub=>orionrobots-21)/}{CENTER}","title": "New Toy - DLink DSM-G600 NAS Box","postId": 180}, {"FROM_UNIXTIME(created)": "2008-03-21 14:50:44","data": "!Simple fun_plug test
So continuing my work with this box, since it was hackable, I decided the first thing to do was to try a simple test of the fun_plug system mentioned before.

I created a very, very simple script:
{CODE()}
#!/bin/sh
echo Testing >/mnt/HD_a2/fun_plug_active.log
{CODE}

The script is simple enough. The first line tells the system that this file is to be run as a shell with the interpreter at /bin/sh.
The next line simply puts the text \"Testing\" into the file /mnt/HD_a2/fun_plug_active.log.

I uploaded it to the box as /HD_a2/fun_plug using FTP, and then set permissions on that to 777, making the file executable. Rebooting the box should leave a new file on the drive at /mnt/HD_a2/fun_plug_active.log containing the word \"Testing\".

!Getting a move on
Now I was truly cooking. The modding community around this box had figured out cross compiling to this box, and so created a number of binaries (compiled programs) for it already. The first to get was a telnet client, so I could actually interact with the system without waiting for fun_plug to run on a reboot.

I already have a Linux box as well as Cygwin (a way to run some linux based operations in windows) on a windows box. You still require windows to interact with the web front end on the box, which only works properly in Internet Explorer.

!Understanding Busybox
The recommended (by the community) way to get telnet on this box is to use a busybox binary with additional telnet and sed components. Busybox, which I briefly mentioned in my previous post, is a modular system offering many common Linux commands and utilities in a small binary. It is designed to stay resident, have no (or few) external library dependencies, and be very small. All of the commands then run from this binary. It is perfect for use on embedded devices like this.

Busybox has an interesting way to identify which module is being called. You can run busybox directly, with the required command as a first parameter. However, the recommended way is to use a symbolic link (a file that links to the content of another file) which has the required modules name - this then conveniently means pointing the path at a directory of these symlinks allows them to be run as if they were all individual binary commands. Busybox commands are largely compatible with normal Linux equivalents, but are understandably lighter, so some less used or inappropriate (very intensive) options will be stripped away.

The box already has a busybox binary of its own, but that is somewhat limited. I grabbed the binary from [http://download.dsmg600.info/busybox-telnetd-1.2.1.tar.bz2]. Following the community guide, I used 7zip to extract it to a folder.

You should now end up with a couple of files - busybox, sed and a readme.txt.

The readme.txt is very handy, it actually contains information on getting telnet running with this set. I copied over the binaries to the root of the disk on the box, and placed the commands mentioned in the readme into the fun_plug script.

!!About Telnet

Telnet allows remote access to a box via a command line, it is a simple and lightweight protocol and has been around for many, many years. However, on this box, it requires a few changes to groups, users and security in the configuration.

The box uses a standard Linux configuration, in that it stores users and groups in files in the /etc directory as plain text files. However, these files are stored in a compressed image in the flash, and then expanded to a ramdisk on boot. Therefore, we must use fun_plug to make the changes on boot, before the telnet service is started.

Sed is a tool designed to modify text files. It means \"stream editor\" where the input text is considered a simple stream of text coming at the processor. It has a fairly esoteric and complex syntax based on regular expressions - and I generally have to regularly refer to a regular expression cheat sheet. Regular expressions are a shorthand way to denote changes to text, operations like search and replace.

Luckily, I did not have to think too much about the sed scripts, as the G600 community had already come up with them. However, I will explain them.

{CODE()}
#!/bin/sh
if [ ! -e /mnt/HD_a2/ash ]
then
ln -s /mnt/HD_a2/busybox /mnt/HD_a2/ash
fi
if [ ! `grep root /etc/shadow` ]
then
echo kontroll.`grep admin /etc/shadow` >> /etc/shadow
/mnt/HD_a2/sed -i -e \'s/kontroll.admin/root/\' /etc/shadow
fi
/mnt/HD_a2/sed -i -e \'s/root:.*/root:x:0:0:Linux User,,,:\\/:\\/mnt\\/HD_a2\\/ash/\' /etc/passwd
cd /dev && /mnt/HD_a2/busybox makedevs ptyp c 2 0 0 9
cd /dev && /mnt/HD_a2/busybox makedevs ttyp c 3 0 0 9
/mnt/HD_a2/busybox telnetd &
{CODE}

The first line, as above, expresses that this script should be run by /bin/bash.
The next line checks for the existence of the file /mnt/HD_a2/ash. Ash is another shell interpreter, somewhat more friendly than raw sh. It is what a user will get when the telnet in. If it does not exist (the \"!\" is a negative test), then \"ln -s\" is used to create one of the symlinks I discussed above. This symlink to busybox will run the module ash in busybox.

\"fi\" simply ends an if statement.

The existence of a \"root\" user in the file /etc/shadow is tested for - grep is a tool to find regular expressions in files, and /etc/shadow is one of the user configuration files under /etc which contains users adn encrypted passwords. This negative test leads to the use of echo to append the admin users details to the end of the file again. The word \"kontroll.\" is used as a placeholder, so the next operation which uses Sed to switch kontroll.admin for root gives us a standard root user.

Sed is then used to set up a default shell (the ash shell) so the user can log on. If at this point you want to add another user (beyond root) and allow them to logon, you should create a user from the front interface, and then add an entry to set a shell for them. I added myself, as I do not always want to be root.

Next, a telnet session needs a terminal device to attach itself to. A command makedev (in busybox) is used to create those devices.
Finally, the telnet service is started.

After the box is rebooted, I was able to log in with telnet. This now means I can start to do a lot more to manipulate the box.

My plans included getting an SVN server running on the box, with trac - although apache is too heavy, their may be another way to do that. The community website mentions getting Debian and Gentoo environments running on this box.

In this post I will explain a little more about how it works and what it is for.

Telnet is a little like a telephone service:

{img src=show_image.php?id=456 align=center}

Like the telephone, it allows a caller (client) to place a call (connection) with a receiver (service). It allows a text based dialog with something at the other end.

{img src=show_image.php?id=460 align=center}

This however simply provides, like a phone line, a pipe to facilitate communication. To make it useful, it needs to have something to transmit to and from. In the case of a phone line, you have a caller and receiver:

{img src=show_image.php?id=457 align=center}

By the way, the reason the phone line analogy works pretty well is that in computer networks, some links are likely to actually __be__ phone lines. These worlds are actually fairly close. Replacing a caller with a computer user, and the receiver with an application the user wants to interact with at the other end gives a full picture:

{img src=show_image.php?id=462 align=center}

Both the application and Telnet service are likely to be running on the same remote machine, in this case the DSM-G600. It is now clear that once the protocol is understood, any authentication has taken place and the connection is established, the telnet service layer should become transparent:

{img src=show_image.php?id=461 align=center}

Still with me?

On the DSM-G600, I placed the Busybox application which provides a collection of services. Among them is a shell - Ash. This shell is similar to an MS DOS command line and allows you to query the system and run other programs.

!How to connect?
So in the last post, I set up the services. I still need a telnet client. The best (in my humble opinion) telnet client for windows is Putty. It is free and easy to set up. The link is at the end of this post.

Like a phone number, you will need the address of the G600 - mine is at 192.168.1.7. Putty also allows a choice of protocols, so at this point I ensure I pick telnet.

{img src=show_image.php?id=458 align=center}

After clicking ok, if all goes well, the Telnet services will respond with a login prompt:

{img src=show_image.php?id=459 align=left}

Use \"root\" for the user, and the admin password you set up on the DSM-G600.

You should now be interacting with the Ash shell and it will prompt you:

{img src=show_image.php?id=454 align=left}

Ash, as mentioned, allows you to run programs and examine the system. To prove this works, I run the \"ls\" program which will list the contents of the current directory on the box. It is a little like \"dir\" in DOS.

{img src=show_image.php?id=455 align=left}

!Summary
So now you know what telnet is, how to get the service running on the DSM-G600, how to connect to it and how to start interacting with it via the Ash shell.

I have been thinking about AI\'s and chatbots for twitter and will be figuring out which I can adapt myself. However, there are plenty of clever tweeps out there who might be able to code their own or adapt something.
Bring out your Twitter AI\'s! If you simply pipe twitter to Alice or Eliza, or even Psychoanalyze-pinhead, code your own complete AI, dust off and bring out NIALL then I want to know here.

So here - put your best twitter chat bot forward - a link to twitter to follow, as a comment, and tell us a little about how it is written. I will be getting people to test it from around the twitterverse (is that a word?) at silly hours of the day, to ensure it really is a bot (it may be hard to prove this bit).

So go on - give us your best, chattiest bot - I want to hear from you. Let the OrionRobots Twitter Turing Test Begin! 

For those who want a short name, I am thinking Twuring!

Rules:
* Must be on twitter - with its own profile.
* Twitter profile should state it is a bot, and an entry to twuring.
* Be prepared to tell us a little of how you did it (enough to prove it is a bot and not a fake) - a link to a blog/article about how you did it would be good.

This is now being tracked (including a twitter widget to see recent activity) on http://squidoo.com/twuring.
","title": "Twuring - The Orionrobots Twitter Turing Test","postId": 193}, {"FROM_UNIXTIME(created)": "2008-06-02 09:09:13","data": "As I have been looking at wiring up my flat, I have been thinking of ways to conserve power and space - cable space that is. There is nothing I am more interested in right now than ways to banish \"wall warts\" - the many, many small 12v ((DC)) adaptors. Nearly every device has one, my mobile phone, landline phone, the NAS, monitor, printer, ((microcontroller)) programmers, guitar effects unit. The list actually goes on and on.

Even the PC has its switched power supply supplying ((DC)) to most of the components. Why am I having to convert to ((DC)) over and over?

So I started looking at alternatives. Could one decent switched power supply sort this out?

I am aware of the issues. First - each of those power supplies has different voltage and wattage outputs for device requirements. Devices must not be overloaded, or underpowered .Also, any solution must not load up one mains plug over its own rating. cables for power delivery must be safe and have the correct wire pitch and insulation. It needs to be able to safely deal with surges, and for my requirements work out as a relatively inexpensive product.

The system needs to be in the market presently, or shortly available (in the next 6 months). It should also, preferably link up with the data solution, as a number of devices also have a data line to go with them, although the data requirement is not really essential.

I have come across a few potential ideas for this, some are products on the market, some are things I could homebrew. That is an interesting trade off, as while I like doing homebrew, this is electrical power, and although the voltages are low, a semi-permanent installation like this needs to be bulletproof. Also, it needs to be fairly readily expandable, and an off-the-shelf solution is going to be somewhat easier.

That then throws up one last problem, is that the availability needs to be good. I do not want to invest in a system that will disappear in a couple of years, that was created by one obscure group or company - the system needs to be pretty standard, and the standards well documented. Preferably not too heavily patent encumbered.

Tricky customer aren\'t I?

!Possible Solutions

!!Wiring a 12 volt rail through the house
An old friend lives in a house out in the moors, where he generates his own power through both a diesel generator and a wind turbine. The house came with very old wiring, not really suitable for safe use at 240 volts. He hired an electrician to wire the 240 volts, and converted the old wiring into a 12 volt DC system. 

* Pros
** The system was there, readily available. This included wiring, and old style electrical sockets.
** Takes up little space.

* Cons
** My own flat and most others have no such system, and while I would condone new builds to have some such line, it would be very expensive and messy to retrofit.
** Devices that take less than 12 volts will have to have regulators, and devices which take a little more will be a problem.
** The lines will be pretty noisy, and therefore additional smoothing is probably required at device endpoints.
** No data lines.

In conclusion, while it suits him well, it is probably not appropriate for myself.

!!Greenplug
Greenplug are a company producing a single power unit to replace many power units. They are also courting consumer electronics manufacturers to try and get them to ship Greenplug cables instead of wall warts.

* Pros
** This is a set of good look devices.
** This has potential if it is supported by the manufacturers.
** Negotiable power - means that devices will be able to request power, no switches or matching.
** Power saving - devices may be able to inform the greenplug when they go into a low power mode or have stopped charging.
** Based on a hybrid ((USB)) universal connector.
** Can offer basic ((USB)) power for normal ((USB)) powered devices.

* Cons
** Not yet available in shops.
** Likely to be expensive.
** Hubs do not have many ports.
** Manufacturer support not yet available.
** Only one company is currently building parts, although there may come a point where it is simply licensed commodity technology.

This is a possible solution, although I would have to wait a while for it to become available.

!!PoweredUSB
This is a standard created by a consortium of companies, designed for use in the EPOS (Electronic point of sale) realm for retail groups. 

* Pros
** A standard supported by a number of major players, including IBM and MS.
** Offers a power management system like Greenplug.
** Connectors come with clip on parts to make a more secure power connection.
** Offers data and power.

* Cons
** This has crippling patent encumbrance and may be extremely expensive due to this. This includes the power management system.
** Not widely available - most devices are only in EPOS realm.
** Standards for device connection are not agreed upon yet, with different manufacturers using different methods.
** Not really available for consumer level usage.

In conclusion this is not really a player. The expense, encumbrance, the lack of standardisation for end points and distance from consumer devices is a bit of a put off. For now, this is not an option.

!!PoE and 802.3af
This first sounded like a bit of a joke, an April fools. But it turns out this is a real and readily available way to send both power and data over a single cable. It is also a standard, implementable by many.

* Pros
** Readily available - I can go to Google and find devices to purchase right now.
** Works with existing Ethernet networks - 10/100.
** Reasonably cheap with low, mid and high end ranges.
** Fully standardised with a few satellite standards.
** Homebrews well documented and circuits available.
** Scales through voltages based on a resistance.
** Done properly is still compatible with non POE devices.
** Been used in the field for a while.
** Uses very common and cheap Ethernet Rj45 plugs, and standard Cat5 cabling.

* Cons
** done very cheaply it is not compatible with non POE devices.
** The voltage selection seems to only be negotiable at start up, and cannot adapt to device requirements like the Greenplug.
** May not be compatible with gigabit Ethernet apart from high end range.
** Ethernet network may not be available (but in my case it is).
** Will probably need splitters at end points for all the devices that do not yet use PoE.
** Ethernet connectors and splitters considered relatively large when compared with Greenplug.
** Not usable directly for USB powered devices.

This is probably the most appealing solution yet. There are even whole thin-client terminals based on PoE. 

!Readers Call to action
I am relatively sure that I have only covered a very small portion of the possible ways to do this, and there are more to consider. 
So do you know any systems? Could you advise me, or tell me your experiences with these devices? Maybe you are a company with products like this trying to make yourself known - in which case you are free to leave a comment on this article with a link back to your site.

","title": "Power and data transmission","postId": 184}, {"FROM_UNIXTIME(created)": "2008-07-06 15:58:00","data": "I recently attended the Micromouse 2008 event at Millenium Point in Birmingham, so I could watch superb robots try their luck in the maze, and meet a number of other seasoned and not so seasoned robot builders. 

!About Micromouse
Micromouse robots are REAL robots. They are not remote controlled, and must come with all their own control circuitry, at least those beyond a certain cheeky number (well letter actually). 

Micromouse has been running for a very long time, since around 1979, when the Amazing Micromouse Maze Contest was held. I last attended one when it was held during a Tomorrows World Megalab event in the NEC in Birmingham.

Micromouse is held once a year, although other similar events are held throughout the year. If you enjoy building robots, or simply want to meet with other robot builders, this event is highly recommended. It is even better if you turn up with a robot to try in the games, although I did not this time. You will be able to exchange tips and techniques as well as being able to test the robot in a pretty serious event.

!The current event
UK Micromouse 2008 was hosted by Birmingham City University and ThinkTank, an interactive science museum with a regular robot club, and Lego robolab events.

The maze itself was based on a large board with holes for pegs, and a system of pegs and walls used to construct the mazes. There was more than one maze - a maze designed for non-contact maze solvers, and a smaller, simpler maze for the contact followers. 


Because this is a gathering of robot builders, a number of other competitions and side events, such as line following, drag races, walking robots, robot soccer, mini-sumo, walking robots and just general showcasing of robots gear take place too. There was also plenty of kit (ie oscilloscopes, soldering gear, multimeters, logic testers) for testing and debugging robots.

The mazes used a timing system that is based on infrared sensors to detect when the mouse has left the starting square, and when it has entered the goal area. This could be armed with a control board, and the numbers fed into a database system so they could be used to create scoreboards later. The system worked fairly well, although there were a few issues, and the automatic sensor triggers had to be turned off for a particular group of robots based on the same kit.

Among the most well known there is probably Professor Martin Smith, known for being a judge on robot wars and having built robots himself too. He lead the proceedings as the Master of ceremonies, gave commentary to the finals and was also quite good just to chat with - a very down to earth guy. 

Also present was Chris Hills of Pheadrus Systems Ltd who normally works with real time embedded operating systems for control engineering applications, although at the event they were also flogging off a bunch of development boards at £15 or less. The chap also writes for Embedded Systems Engineering. He donated the development boards and kits that were awarded as prizes.

I will be following this up with a number of posts based on interviews, and less formal chats I had with some of the characters that attend this event, so read on for more!

There is currently a disappointing tendency for robotics to be (like engineering and computing subjects in general) a very male dominated discipline. To meet two young ladies, who are not only interested, but built their own robots and competed in the challenges, is a real breath of fresh air, and proves that girls can have fun taking part in these things.

I spent some time chatting with the two sisters. Their father, Derek Hall, entered the robots that took first and second prizes in the non contact maze solving event, and has been a MicroMouse champion for 4 years running, so it kind of runs in the family. It all starts there, and Prof. Martin Smith even remembers Chloe being hauled along to MicroMouse events when still in the pushchair.

!Their Robots
{DIV(float=>right)}{img src=/show_image.php?id=542 width=200}{DIV}Chloe has been building robots since she was 9, and actually brought two robots to the 2008 event. They were Snoopy, which is entirely her own build (although she borrowed some ideas for it from her older sister), and Redeye, a robot that she has maintained for a while. Both are quite creative and different.

Shannon built the robot Cheese Detective - a robot based on simple electronics and uses a part of a CD, Snoopy is similar in that it is also based on simple electronics and uses a CD for a sensor. However, it does have differences. Snoopy is smaller and lighter for a start, and the CD is at the bottom of the bot instead of the top-heavy cheese detective. Snoopy is not without its problems, and during the drag race it demonstrated it needed a new gearbox due to pulling to the side a lot while running the race. Snoopy was also once the \"Easter Chicken Bot\", and had a small chicken mascot stuck to it, although that fell off. I did point out (in jest) that perhaps \"Woodstock\" would have been a more apt title.

Chloeâ€™s first robot was Slowpoke, and later \"Not-So-Slowpoke\", an all mechanical robot, that (according to Chloe) would simply drop out of the end of mazes when done.

!More about Chloe
Chloe enjoys building robots from junk, and uses materials like broken CD/DVDs (as mentioned above), credit cards and other stuff. As you may know, we really like robots built from junk on OrionRobots. She also likes to decorate her robots, an area that was mostly lacking in many MicroMouse robots. Although we like to see the guts of a robot, a little bit of presentation and not taking it too seriously also help.

Chloe is now 15, and is just getting on with her GCSEâ€™s at the Stanway School, Colchester. There is a robotics club, and she is trying to start a separate MicroMouse robots club at the school too. She has been able to use a well kitted out DT lab at school with plastic moulding, laser cutters as well as simpler hand tools, and also borrow tools or materials from her Dadâ€™s robot building kit, although that is going to be on the terms that she uses it safely, looks after it and returns them I suspect.

Both Chloe and Shannon were pretty interesting to chat with, and clearly knew their stuff. They both also conveyed the message that it would be good to see more girls in the show, and even more contenders in their age group who are not school affiliated. If you are able to build robots, now is a good time to start reading up about MicroMouse and preparing your maze running robots for the next event. 

!Challenge to any takers
Do you think you have what it takes to beat these two youngsters? Who took first and second prize in their competition?

I have tried various methods, fishing tackle trays, large component racks, sealy bags in self made boxes (which was okay), but all came with flaws or lead to trying too many slots before the required component was found.

I\'ve now come across an awesome constructable:

Behaviour Driven Development is a current practice in programming that is changing the way coders are thinking, bringing testing, coding and design closer together, the theory being that things get done right and work sooner, instead of nearly working, being not quite what anybody wanted, and having very little to measure against.

A set of Behaviour specifications, such as the type built with the tool Rspec, growing as functionality is schedule to be introduced to a product, gives a specification that can be run against the code, show where it is deficient, and when other features, or changes are introduced, can quickly highlight a regression. A regression caught as it was created should be relatively easy to find. A regression caught a few months later in end-of-product testing will be much harder to fix, when there is nearly no time left to fix it. 

So Behaviour Driven Development is about quality, about confidence in the code doing what it should, about clear communication about what it should be doing so that the tester, coder and designer are all talking in the same language.

C++ is currently less developed in this realm than Ruby or Java, but it is catching up. These tools are being created, and probably need to borrow a little from each other as well as support from both the C++, BDD and Test Driven Development community to start to flourish. They will need to be linked up with CI systems like Hudson or Cruise Control to really fly, but as they are, embryonic, CppSpec and Igloo can both give value to a product.

They may even be manne from a distance, flown or driven remotely.

!What are Chicken Walkers?
Chicken walkers are robotic platforms in both futuristic and steampunk sci-fi. They are essentially a pair of robotic legs upon which a human can ride, either to allow him to carry heavier things over a distance, or to give a disabled person the ability to get around, or simply with legs and a surface as a platform to carry stuff around.

This video has details on a chicken walker costume (not really a robot), which lifts its legs when a wearer does. It looks more futuristic than steampunk, but the basic idea could be adapted.

It appears that others have definitely got there first with some amazing factories, built entirely with Lego, using Mindstorms kits to pick and place and manufacture Lego models. Indeed the earliest I saw (and possibly not the earliest built), was a few years ago. So what is there?

The first I knew of was the Mindstorms Autofabrick - a Car factory.

{YOUTUBE(movie=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQ3AcPEPbH0\",allowFullScreen=\"y\")}{YOUTUBE}

Then this one, uses the chain links from a Lego technic bulldozer set to make a conveyor, and shows a much simpler pick and place action.

A fabulous aircraft making factory, built using 25 RCX\'s and 73 Motors. It cost around 8000€ to build, and took over 1000 man hours - an epic creation.

All of those, while amazing, are not as flexible as this latest offering, which was demonstrated at Legoworld 2010 in NL. It is using the NXT and is a monster with 50k Lines Of Code, running on 5 NXT\'s. Fewer than the 25 RCX\'s, but yet appears to be a more flexible setup. It is actually putting together Lego designs made in LDD - a simple CAD app from Lego themselves. Truly the greatest of these fabrication plants so far.

I paid them a visit to see what I made of it.

First the staff - the store was pretty busy, but the staff were friendly and chatty. They were not necessarily all Lego nuts, but they did know the product and they did help out, including answering a bunch of questions. We were buying stuff for our daughter which helped.

There is a fairly good selection of Lego, including the mindstorms and Lego Technic kit. The NXT 2.0 set was there - with quite a few stocked, as well as many of the power functions motors, battery boxes, cables and controllers - these were just on a simple plain rack so those a little more technical could grab exactly what power gear they needed.

The Pick-a-brick setup, if you aren\'t familiar with the idea, is a bunch of buckets arranged on a wall with scoops to measure out lego bricks, and you are charged for what you take. Very simple way if you need that many red fence pieces or some similar thing. Obviously there is only a limited number of boxes, so don\'t expect to find obscure or technic pieces.

There is a \"make-your-own-minifig\" area, where punters can select heads, headgear, tools, bodys, legs and other accessories to make a minifig, then pay to take that home. Boxes for them are provided.

Also in the store, the current flavour of the month is displayed, as we went in that was the [http://www.squidoo.com/lego-hero-factory-theme|Lego Hero Factory theme]. 

The layout is pretty well thought out, given that youngsters will want to run around, and there was a very big bucket of duplo set into a table with two studded surfaces, so the toddlers can build towers (as our little one did). Or indeed knock each others over. Each Lego theme has a separate area on the wall, including some special bits.

There were some interesting kits I\'ve not seen before like a minifig display case. In terms of branded accessories, there were wallets - in white with the Logo, many minifig and tiny model keyrings, Lego cups, Lego beachtowels and a white satchel. Shame none were in darker colours, and a shame that they had none of the other apparel.

I\'d like to explain why this was chosen.</p>
<p>
	The first is that these are easily replaceable. Specialist batteries would be hard to replace and expensive. Rechargeable batteries do eventually stop charging, and those made for a single product tend to end up impossible to replace - have you ever tried to get replacement batteries for an old laptop? AA\'s are ubiquitous - that is, they are really easy to find. </p>
<p>
	Another thing is the cost - cost is important to me with this. Specialist batteries are expensive to develop, and expensive per part. Specialist charging hardware on the robot would also increase its cost, complexity and weight. AA batteries come in a range of prices - and can be bought in bulk for education or for serious gadget geeks. </p>
<p>
	Weight - while Lithion Ion/Li Poly batteries, weight for weight would probably be more weight effective than AA\'s, but may not be able to provide the current needed for driving motors comfortably. Lead Acid batteries would deliver the current, but are quite weighty.<a href=\"http://shop.orionrobots.co.uk/collections/30-minute-robot/products/orion-explorer-1-robot-kit\" title=\"Orion Explorer 1 Robot Kit\"><img alt=\"The Orion Explorer 1 Robot\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0203/7288/products/Orion_Explorer_1_Robot_Kit_Assembled_compact.jpg?252\" style=\"margin-top:4px;margin-left:4px;margin-bottom:4px;float:right;\" /></a></p>
<p>
	Shipping - shipping largish batteries is actually a little complicated - they can be risky. An AA battery box means the customer can easily source their own. Many couriers refuse to take batteries without a premium or special service because they have a reputation for causing damage, from leaking to actually becoming a fire or explosive risk.</p>
<p>
	Battery Technology - AA batteries have not been the leading edge of the technology, far from state of the art, but they have been changing. They are becoming higher capacity, able to deliver higher currents and are seeing battery chemistry improvements. If there was a bespoke solution - it would be harder to later modify to accept newer batteries.</p>
<p>
	In short the main reasons are a little bit of future proofing, keeping costs reasonable and the size/weight of the robot. There is no reason a customer couldn\'t modify it and add in a different battery type of their choosing - an RC pack or similar if they wished to. Personally - I\'ll stick to my AA\'s. </p>
","title": "Why are we using AA batteries?","postId": 222}, {"FROM_UNIXTIME(created)": "2013-04-02 04:16:00","data": "<p>
	I\'ve now got some footage of the Explorer 1 using a pair of sonar distance modules (HC-SR04\'s) to avoid walls and drive around the floor. This is just experimentation, so they are mounted with sticky tac, and wired in with some odd bit of breadboard I had, but it was working brilliantly here. The robot has an Arduino and uses AA batteries.</p>
<p>
	 {module module=\"youtube\" ids=\"ElXsXAcqrUE\" width=\"315\" notitle=\"y\"}  </p>
<p>The 2 sensors give it directional sensing - which means it can avoid obstacles from either side.</p>
<p>
	The algorithm here is quite simple. If the left sensor, or right is less than a threshold distance, then turn away from the closer one until both are clear, otherwise move forward.</p>
<p>
	It took some tinkering to get right. I am still playing with the sensor thresholds in the code, along with the angle and distance apart for them. The next behaviour will be more interesting - following things. I\'d like to have this robot following objects while keeping a distance from them - I\'ve done the crude follow until it collides, but the following with a bit of distance is much more interesting behaviour indeed.</p>
<p>
	I\'d love to get this into some kind of maze to see how well it avoids - although it is a bit large for Micromouse - and doesn\'t have a solving strategy - it does get into a feedback oscillation faced with a corner or walls either side.</p>
<p>
	This will eventually be a kit including some brackets and simplified solder free wiring on my Uk robotics shop.</p>

I am currently looking at ways to embed the Raspberry Pi on my robots - eventually there will be an Orion Explorer robot kit that includes this. The Embedded Pi extends the Pi by adding Arduino shield compatible IO, and it has standalone functionality by having a 32 bit Arm Cortex M3 Microcontroller onboard which can be programmed with a free IDE.</p>
<p>
	It has on board logic level shifters, so shields and parts that are 5v will work with this. The shifter used on it is the <a href=\"http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/txs0108e.pdf\">TXS0108EPWR</a> - a device similar to others I am looking at.</p>
<p>
	I intend to experiment with the Pi on a robot using this, and with this as a standalone controller. It will be fun, and shield compatibility is neat, however, the next two items may mean that it wouldn\'t be required as part of a kit.</p>
<h1>
	Logic Level Shifters</h1>
<p>
	<img alt=\"Image\" class=\"regImage pluginImg48\" src=\"http://orionrobots.co.uk/dl48&amp;display\" style=\"font-size:.75em;line-height:1.5em;width:160px;height:135px;float:left;margin-left:2px;margin-right:2px;\" />Interfacing with the Pi is different from the Arduino for a few reasons. A key one is the voltages of the IO pins. The Pi presents logic at 3.3v, and a number of IO systems require this to be at 5v.</p>
<p>
	To experiment with this, a colleague has lent me a 74HC125b1 DIP chip and I\'ve bought 5 MAX3377E chips. The former is a single directional shifter, and the MAXIM chip is bidirectional - making the latter perfect for sensors.</p>
<p>

I can see the possibility of using OpenCV (Computer Vision project) with the rPi on a robot for some advanced play - ahem - experimentation. It has a ribbon connector that goes straight into the Pi.</p>

	It has been long anticipated - and I made sure to order in the first round. This can mean that I may end up with one with problems that are later fixed, but it also means I get to play with it early.</p>
<p>
	I\'ll be trying this out after doing the stuff with the level shifting above. Expect to see this mounted on an Explorer 1 robot.</p>

	A final note on the dual Sonar distance board. I\'ve already found manufacturers for the board, but I\'m now planning to revise the initial design to incorporate a level shifter, making it compatible with both the Arduino, the Raspberry Pi, and most other controllers on the market. More on this when the design is closer to completion. I expect it to be on the store in around a month, accompanied with code for the Arduino, and later similar code for the Pi.</p>
