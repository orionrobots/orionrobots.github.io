description: Photos from the Micromouse 2008 event at Millenium Point in Birmingham.
  This included many robots events - maze solving, drag racing, minisumo and walking
  robots. Discussion of these start at http://orionrobots.co.uk/blogs/1/185. OrionRobots
  apologises if any contender or robot names are wrong - let us know ASAP and it will
  be fixed.
