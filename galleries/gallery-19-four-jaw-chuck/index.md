description: 'This is Danny Staple''s work on an all Lego four jaw rotating chuck,
  designed for his lathe. '

- {caption: 'Here the chuck can be seen holding a polystyrene block. It is a pretty
    firm grip when tightened, and a fair amount of tugging or torsion can occur. The
    2x4 brick parts of the jaw are the obvious weak points, but testing showed that
    the polystyrene was more likely to go.', date: !!timestamp '2007-01-03 17:55:33',

- {caption: 'This is a view of the chuck at its widest extent. I am aware that the
    transmission between the arms may be vulnerable to kerf, but be aware that the
    mechanism will be deployed vertically with the job held horizontally, so it should
    not be in the path of it.', date: !!timestamp '2007-01-03 17:55:33', name: Chuck1_4.JPG,

- {caption: 'Here you can see the underside of the Mark I chuck. Any of the four sets
    of 2x2 round bricks can be used to adjust the chuck, and they are balanced so
    that the chuck spins without any weight issues. I will worry about brick colours
    once I have a working lathe.', date: !!timestamp '2007-01-03 17:55:34', name: Chuck1_5.JPG,

- {caption: 'Here I have completely removed one of the jaws, so the mechanism can
    be seen. The grey double bevel gear is driven underneath by a hidden worm gear.
    The worm gear is driven from the axle connecting to the inner black double bevel
    gear. This is a symmetrical arrangement for all four jaws. All the black double
    bevel gears engage a central grey single bevel gear so they drive their neighbours.
    This means they all contract together, and effectively self centre.', date: !!timestamp '2007-01-03

- {caption: I have partially disassembled the chuck so the rack and gear mechanism
    engaging the sliding jaws can be seen. Note that the central distribution gear
    can be seen in the middle. This is the Mark I - the Mark II has a removable key
    replacing the 2*2 round bricks on each side., date: !!timestamp '2007-01-03 17:55:51',
