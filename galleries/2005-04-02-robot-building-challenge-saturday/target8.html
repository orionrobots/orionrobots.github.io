<h2>The Technic Lego Robots Face off in the arena.</h2>
<p>
    Note that because of gearing, the controller in one is facing the opposite direction.
    The DJ (with the gearing on the left) has gearing down, and four wheel drive - a clear pushing advantage.
    The GD on the right may have a speed advantage since it doesn't gear down.
