<p>Dale & Janak Close up of the top of Dale & Janaks robot.
    Those chunky balloon tyres are some of the favourites - and for a size larger than a 40t,
    they have some of the best grip without going into complex compound tyres.
    Danny is in the background - trying to push some steering out of their robot - not a lot he can do though, build time is over.</p>
