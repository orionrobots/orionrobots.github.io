<p>This is a close up of the bottom of the Leog Technic Robot made by Danny & Gabriel for the Sumo Challenge.
    It might be able to run both ways up.
    You can see the construction of the forks - a weapon and bumper - is not too solid.
    They fell off almost the first time they hit something.
    Danny and Gabriel did try to mirror Dale & Janaks bumpers along the entire length of the robot.
    But they didnt really use enough pins -
    and the big chunk was only stuck down on the top of the long side panels - with one extra beam on top.
    It came off rather easily.</p>
