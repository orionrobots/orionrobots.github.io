    The image shows the Lego Technic Robot built by Gabriel and Danny, stuck while trying to drive around a course.
    This Lego Technic robot did not steer well - it dragged on the floor, and handled horribly.
    This is a real pity - because it was well recognised (from other events) that Danny was the best driver in the group.
