      caption: This is a close-up of the signal generator clipped into my test rig. Note if you can - there are two capacitors clipped in series with this (note the opposite polarities) - this was my attempt to filter a DC offset from the signal generator. I may later embed a couple of these caps in the generator itself at a later date. The other two cables (they have yellow plastic jackets which caught the flash and are not about to ignite) are linking the waveform generator board with the inputs of amplifier board. It is using both that allowed me to build a whole generator - I needed more oomph than the signal generator board alone had to actually see it go through diodes at all - remember the 0.6v trigger voltage.

      caption: 	I have now got the oscilloscope fired up, the signal generator tested (which you might faintly see on the Oscilloscope trace) and the bridge ready to test.
