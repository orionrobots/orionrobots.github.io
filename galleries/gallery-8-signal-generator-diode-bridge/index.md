      this shortly - but for some this picture may be inspiration enough.

  - caption: "Here you get a good view of the full rig, including one of the better\
      \ shots of the signal generator (in the transparent box).\r\n\r\nThe freeform\
      \ bridge is tiny in the jump-leads, enough that I nearly dropped and lost it.\
      \ That is a good sign though - it means it is likely to fit in a Lego brick."

  - caption: "Here is the first result. Although the bridge is not visible here, you\
      \ can see that (taking into account a DC offset) it has clearly changed the full\
      \ sinewave - rectifying the negative portion.\r\n\r\nHere is also a good view\
      \ of the guts of the signal generator. That tiny little trimpot on the board is\
      \ currently the way to change the amplitude before the amp, and the set of 4 jumpers\
      \ is how you select the waveform. As these are facing inward, I actually need\
      \ to open the case to modify them. The frequency is fixed.\r\n\r\nAs I said in\
      \ my blog - I will have to add some more convenient switches and dials to the\
      \ box when I find a moment - but for now, it sufficed."

  - caption: "I then added the capacitors to trim off the DC offset - and behold, a\
      \ fully rectified waveform. Exactly what I was looking for.\r\nSo this tiny little\
      \ bridge works, and being small enough to fit inside a Lego brick, or other apparatus\
      \ will come in very handy."

  - caption: This is my oscilloscope showing the full wave generated by my signal generator
      - its quite clean. Sorry - I have not got the full calibrations in shot, so the
      frequency is not clear.

  - caption: This is a close-up of the signal generator clipped into my test rig. Note
      if you can - there are two capacitors clipped in series with this (note the opposite
      polarities) - this was my attempt to filter a DC offset from the signal generator.
      I may later embed a couple of these caps in the generator itself at a later date.
      The other two cables (they have yellow plastic jackets which caught the flash
      and are not about to ignite) are linking the waveform generator board with the
      inputs of amplifier board. It is using both that allowed me to build a whole generator
      - I needed more oomph than the signal generator board alone had to actually see
      it go through diodes at all - remember the 0.6v trigger voltage.

      you might faintly see on the Oscilloscope trace) and the bridge ready to test.

  - caption: "Here I've used Picasas collage to try and super impose the two waveforms\
      \ - not too bad!\r\nI do not have a dual trace oscilloscope, so this was the only\
      \ way to do it.\r\nI note that the calibration of the scope has changed between\
      \ the two measurements - but lets examine the results ignoring that.\r\nThere\
      \ also appears to be a DC offset on the diode outputs - not sure about that, given\
      \ that I took it off the sinewave, however I can reason that it is shorter due\
      \ to the 1.2 volts or so used by the bridge itself. The fact that the peaks are\
      \ symmetrical shows that it is balanced and stable. \r\nIn fact - if there was\
      \ a DC offset on the input waveform, there would be two different sets of peaks\
      \ - so it may merely be down to the dial on the oscilloscope. Any other explanations\
      \ you could offer?"
