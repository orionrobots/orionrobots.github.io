## About OrionRobots

We love robotics. Here are 3 good reasons why:
1. Robotics can be used to promote ICT/STEM learning - for both adults and children, this can increase computer,
   electronic, technological literacy.
2. Closing the gap between having an idea and building it - when a kid or adult has an idea for a new contraption,
   having kits to build upon, to experiment with to get there vastly reduces the barrier to entry.
3. Because robots are fun and we personally like tinkering with them!

### The Longer Version
Orionrobots aim is to make building robots easy and widely available as a hobby, personal learning experience or for
starting out a research project to build an awesome machine. We want to make available items to get to this goal as
fast as we can, without it costing £100's of pounds to try it out, and without giving a system that is too simple to
be customised and expanded.

These robots are for you to make, explore and play with- they are not industrial robots or robots for factory lines.
You could use our robots for small scale automation in your home or a small business if you customised it - but we
do not aim to compete with ABB.

Most of our products here will be SOLDERLESS. We've nothing against soldering, but when trying to build, learn and
prototype, it takes up time and can form a barrier to some of those otherwise interested in building robots.

Orionrobots has run as a robotics blog and website since 2004, has run robot clubs and hosted one or two robot
building themed birthday parties. Having built a number of robots, and played with many of the products - we have
experience with the items and will use this to build full tutorials on getting robots going.

We are proudly based in the Uk and always have been, but will bring products from across the globe so anybody can
have a go.

We will be looking at making this cheaper, easier and more accessible than robotics and moving gadgets have ever been.
We hope to bring out the inventor in anyone!

A father of 2 and self-confessed complete geek from Richmond, Surrey, Uk.

I have been interested in robots since I was a kid, and was soldering when I was teenager. At age 8 - I said I wanted
to make and sell robots one day.

In 1999, after finding out about Lego Mindstorms, I rebuilt the Lego collection I had as a child but in larger
proportions.

In 2005 I was running a small local robot club for kids, using Lego as a medium. I'd later joined the Aurorans - a
London meetup group about robot building, which inspired me to look for ways to build robots inexpensively and in a
way that people who've not spent their lives tinkering could replicate.

Orionrobots are all about supplying the parts and information that I've been using to build these robots. When I am
not dealing with the daily admin of the shop, I am researching ways to improve our offering. Either making the
Explorer robots simpler to build, extending the functionality, or looking at new exciting things to do.

I am professionally a computer programmer - specialising in automation of testing/building software. I am an
electronics and mechanical hobbyist. I have personally built and tested every item and tutorial on our site. I hope
my customers have as much fun with it as I have, and better yet, are inspired to do more with it.

I am a member of the British Computer Society, have attended PyCon Uk for the past 2 years. I am in the process of
becoming a STEM Ambassador and a member of the Computing At School initiative.
