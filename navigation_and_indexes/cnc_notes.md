## CNC Notes

This is a Collection of notes on my adventures in CNC.

We bought a CNC Machine, intending to use it to prototype new robot stuff, and because prototype fabrication is a fun use of robotics.

I am new to this, but have experience with 3d cad, electronics, robotics, microcontrollers and code - so I should be able to get what I want out of it.

## Starting Point

I have intended to buy or build a CNC device for years - a 3d printer, laser cutter, lathe or router. A device where I can design things and let the computer do the work of turning it into a prototype.

I finally took the decision to buy one after seeing a couple of Ben Heck episodes where he used laser cutters, CNC mills and 3d printers to awesome things.

I went looking around for something I could afford and use. I considered GoCNC who have inexpensive machines, but after reading CNC forums, the 3020 type machines are better known. So I bought one of these for less than £500.

It arrived a few days later - requiring some assembly - attaching the stepper motors. It came with a large control box.
